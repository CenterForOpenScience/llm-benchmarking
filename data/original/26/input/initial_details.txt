[CLAIM]
The claim is tested with data from a longitudinal survey of preschool teachers by regressing participants' joviality at the end of the workweek on their level of relaxation during the previous weekend and their joviality before the previous weekend, as well as measures of detachment, mastery, control, and hassles (all during the previous weekend); and controls for age, gender, having children, work hours per week, and workdays per week. The test demonstrated that relaxation significantly predicted joviality (β = 0.15, p < 0.01)

[HYPOTHESES]
Relaxation during the weekend is positively associated with joviality [at the end of the following week]

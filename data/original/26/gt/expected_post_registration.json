            "statement": "The claim is tested with data from a longitudinal survey of preschool teachers by regressing participants' joviality at the end of the workweek on their level of relaxation during the previous weekend and their joviality before the previous weekend, as well as measures of detachment, mastery, control, and hassles (all during the previous weekend); and controls for age, gender, having children, work hours per week, and workdays per week. The test demonstrated that relaxation significantly predicted joviality (β = 0.15, p < 0.01)",

Prepare the materials: - three separate surveys (for Time 1, Time 2, Time 3); Time 1 (Friday) for  demographics and baseline affective states (measured with Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-X; (1 = ‘‘not at all’’ to 5 = ‘‘very much’’); Time 2 (Sunday evening) for  weekend recovery experiences (measured with Recovery Experience Questionnaire; five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = ‘‘not at all’’ to 5 = ‘‘very much’’.), non-work hassles (measured with a 53-items checklist of possible hassles; (1 = not at hassle at all to 5 = a big hassle), and affective states; Time 3 (following Friday) measures affective states during the workweek. - instructions,  - stamped return envelopes. 2. Contact heads of preschools, obtain consent for participation and mail survey packages directly to each organization for distribution. 3. Match surveys per participant using a participant-generated identification code and exclude participants with missing surveys. 4. Perform hierarchical regression analysis in three steps: - Step 1: include only demographics (gender, age, having children, work hours per week, workdays per week) - Step 2: add baseline joviality (Time 1) - Step 3: add weekend experiences (relaxation, detachment, mastery, control) and non-work hassles (Time 2). 5. For the result in question specifically, regress joviality at Time 3 on: joviality at Time 1, relaxation, detachment, mastery, control, non-work hassles (Time 2) and demographics (gender, age, having children, work hours per week, workdays per week).",

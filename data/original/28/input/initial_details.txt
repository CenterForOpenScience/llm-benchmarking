Average effort inthe first stage of the two-stage treatment is 84.8 (median = 84). Thus, subjects behave much more competitively in the multistage tournament, exerting efforts that are almost 20% higher than those of their counterparts in the one-stage treatment (average effort = 71.7, median = 75). A Mann-Whitney U-test confirms that the treatment difference is statistically significant (|z| = 2.536, p = .011, two sided)

[HYPOTHESES]
One-stage tournaments are behaviorally different from multistage setups

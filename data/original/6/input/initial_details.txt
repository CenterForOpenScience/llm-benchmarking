[CLAIM]
Overall, most individuals favor either scientific or religious ways of understanding, but many scientifically inclined individuals prefer certain religious accounts. Members of the post-secular category were significantly less likely than members of the traditional group to respond that humans evolved from other animals (3 percent, significant at p < 0.05 on a two-tailed test).

[HYPOTHESIS]
Respondents with a post-secular perspective on science and religion will be less likely than respondents with a traditional perspective on science and religion to respond that humans evolved from other animals.

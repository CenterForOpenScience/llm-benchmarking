            "notes": "Unlike othe work on election fraud, the authors assume (and show) that insurgent violence is not biased in favour or against a particular candidate.This assumption characterizes violence around the Afghanistan election well, but it limits the applicability of the findings to other cases where this may not hold. Also, the authors limited their view of election fraud to manipulation tactics local to the polling centre. Moreover, lacking information about the precise location of polling stations, they were unable to estimate fraud at lower levels, for example, cities. Many of the covariates used in the regression analysis are available only at the district level. All violence indicators are reported as incidents per 1,000 population. The authors created two indicators for development: first, the proportion of households supplied with electricity, and, secondly, the per capita expenditure (in 1,000 s of afghanis)."

Apply the last-digit test to the total vote count and code a binary dependent variable for fraud (which takes the value of 1 if this test is significant at the 5 per cent level for a particular district).\n3. Take violence data from ISAF SIGACT reports and calculate incidents per 1,000 population within five-day (20–24 August) and sixty-day windows around election day.\n4. Georeference ISAF SIGACT, WITS, and ACLED incidents to districts.\n5. Conduct robustness checks for the violence measure using alternative geo-referenced datasets (WITS and ACLED).\n6. Compute great-circle distances from district centres to Kabul.\n7. Derive average district elevation from GTOPO30 raster data.\n8. Aggregate population data from LandScan grid cells.\n9. Construct development indicators: proportion of households with electricity, and per capita expenditure.\n10. Add the number of closed polling stations at the district level as a control.\n11.

The estimation results show the robustness of the positive relationship between agricultural income and residing in a low-caste dominated village.

The field survey was administered in villages drawn at random from 12 districts in Uttar Pradesh and 13 districts in Bihar. A total of 120 villages, with an overall sample size of 2,250 households, were sampled: 57 villages in Bihar and 63 in Uttar Pradesh. All of the study villages are rural and the economies in these areas are primarily dependent on agriculture. The author dropped Muslim households from the analysis (which comprises only 2 percent of the sample in Hindu dominated villages). Regression disturbance terms are clustered at the village level. There are district and state fixed effects"

Restrict the sample to lower-caste households — BAC (Backward Agricultural Castes), OBC (Other Backward Castes), and SC (Scheduled Castes) — and exclude Muslim-dominated villages and Muslim households in Hindu-dominated villages.\n3. Create the binary variable for low-caste dominated villages (1 = low-caste dominated, 0 = high-caste dominated).\n4. Estimate an OLS regression of household crop income per acre on the low-caste village indicator, including household, district, and state-level controls.\n5.

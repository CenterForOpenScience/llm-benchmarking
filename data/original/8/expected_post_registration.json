The experiment was conducted in the districts of Busia, Mumias, and Samia in Western Kenya between May and December of 2009. If more than one household member got sick simultaneously, the authors included all concurrent first episodes, and therefore clustered the standard errors in all illness episode regressions at the household level."

            "steps": "1. The authors selected four rural market centers in Western Kenya and partnered with one drug shop in each; they sampled all households within a 4-kilometer catchment radius, excluding areas near health facilities. \n2. They administered a baseline household survey and distributed two vouchers for artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). \n3. They randomly assigned households using a computerized algorithm (stratified by drug shop, distance quartile, and presence of children) to one of two groups: (a) No Subsidy: Unsubsidized ACTs at the market price. (b) ACT Subsidy: ACTs discounted at 80%, 88%, or 92% subsidy levels. \n4. Then, they recorded voucher redemptions and treatment details for illness episodes at participating drug shops over a four-month period. \n5. Finally, they conducted an endline household survey approximately four months after baseline to document illness episodes, treatment-seeking behavior, and medication use. \n6. Having all the data, they estimated the causal effect of ACT subsidies on ACT access using OLS regressions with household-clustered robust standard errors and strata fixed effects.",

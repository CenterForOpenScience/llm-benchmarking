      "notes": "Blood pressure was measured three times by trained nurses. The first reading was dropped and average of last two used to construct the hypertension variable. Under-diagnosed individuals are those hypertensives at survey but never diagnosed by a doctor. Respondents’ health variablw was constructed using self-reported health status. It was on a 1–4 scale and later dichotomized into ‘good’ vs. ‘poor’ groups. Per capita expenditures (PCE) was used as proxy for household income."

      "description": "The authors analyzed data from the fourth wave of the IFLS, focusing on adults over 45 who were found hypertensive during clinical screenings. They examined how education, time preferences, and other socio-economic factors influence the likelihood of being hypertensive but undiagnosed.",
      "steps": "1. The authors got access to the publicly available Indonesian Family Life Survey dataset.\n2. Then they restricted the sample to hypertensive adults aged 45 and older. \n3. Then, individuals who reported never having been diagnosed with hypertension by a doctor were coded these as under-diagnosed. \n4. The sample was split into those in good health (very healthy or somewhat healthy) and those in poor health (unhealthy or somewhat unhealthy).\n5. Adding explanatory variables including years of education, time and risk preference parameters, age, age squared, per capita household expenditures, distance to nearest health center, and sex, the authors estimated separate probit models for the two subsamples (good vs. poor general health), using the binary under-diagnosis variable as the dependent variable. \n6. Finally, marginal effects for all explanatory variables were computed and reported.",

[CLAIM]
there was faster processing speed v, t(27) = 4.71, p < 0.001, dz = 0.89, and a lower perceptual threshold t0, t(27) = 3.52, p = 0.002, dz = 0.67, when an 85 dB SPL cue is presented prior to the letter, compared to when no cue was present.

[HYPOTHESES]
[P]hasic auditory alertness affects visual perception by increasing the visual processing speed and lowering the threshold of conscious perception

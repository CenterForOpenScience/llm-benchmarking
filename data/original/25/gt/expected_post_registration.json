            "description": "Experiment 1 was a single-letter recognition task in which a high-intensity alerting cue (85 dB) was presented prior to a backward-masked target letter in a third of the trials, and (Theory of Visual Attention) TVA-estimates of visual processing speed and perceptual threshold were compared between the alerting and no-alerting conditions.",
            "steps": "1. Design the experiment (a within-participant design with two conditions: an auditory cue condition, and a no-cue condition. Each session followed a 20 × 8 (letter × exposure duration) structure—160 cue and 320 no-cue trials—and participants complete two 480-trial sessions (960 trials total) in blocks of 40): In one third of the trials, an 85 dB auditory cue is played prior to the presentation of a target letter (85 dB cue condition), whereas in the remaining two thirds there is no auditory. The cue was played equally often at either a high pitch of 900 Hz or at a low pitch of 500 Hz. Target letters are from a set of 20 letters (ABDEFGHJKLMNOPRSTVXZ), each letter is presented once in the cue condition and twice in the no cue condition. Exposure durations come from a set of eight durations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 ms) and each exposure duration is used equally often in both conditions. The ITIs are distributed geometrically using time-steps of 200 ms and a hazard rate of 1/3. This results in a distribution with only a few long ITIs ranging from 1600 to 4000 ms and with an expected ITI of 2000 ms. The CTOAs are distributed geometrically using time-steps of 30 ms and a hazard rate of 2/5 resulting in CTOAs ranging from 200 to 470 ms and an expected CTOA of 244 ms. 2. Recruit and screen participants so that they all have normal or corrected to normal vision and hearing (the authors used Oscilla USB 310 audiometer). The participants were compensated with either an hourly fee or course credit. 3. Set up the environment for the participants: in the experiment they were tested in a semidarkened room with a 21’’ CRT monitor at 100 Hz and stabilised head position (chinrest at ~65 cm viewing distance). 4. Follow the procedure:  4a. During the ITIs, a black fixation cross (0.44x 0.44 of visual angle, 0.39 cd/m2) is presented centrally on a grey background (17.5 cd/m2) and participants are instructed to keep fixation on the cross throughout the presentation. In the cue condition, a trial is initiated by a 200 ms, 85 dB cue played by two loud speakers located next to the monitor. The presentation of the cue is followed by a varying CTOA during which the fixation cross was still presented, thus in the no cue condition, the effective ITI was ITI + CTOA. 4b. A trial proceeds with the presentation of a target letter for a varying exposure duration either 3.4 of visual angle to the left or the right of the fixation cross (measured center-to-center). The location of the letter should be chosen equally often in both conditions. The letters are Arial (broad) size 68 corresponding to 2.0 x 2.5 of visual angle and terminated by two pattern masks presented for 500 ms, one at each of the two locations. The pattern masks were made from black and dark grey letter fragments measuring 3.3 x 3.3 of visual angle, which completely covered the letters.  4c.Next, participants report the letter presented. They are instructed to make a non-speeded report if they are ‘‘fairly certain” of having seen the letter (and refrain from pure guessing). If they don’t recognize the letter, they start the next trial without making a report. A 500 ms feedback display informs participants whether theyare correct (‘*’) or not (‘–’). Participants are encouraged to take small breaks between blocks.  5. Next, estimate v and t0 separately for each participant and condition using maximum-likelihood estimation with a Nelder–Mead optimisation algorithm. Include a high-threshold guessing parameter to account for random guesses when the letter is not encoded into visual short-term memory. 6. For each participant, extract v and t0 for cue and no cue conditions. Conduct paired samples t tests and report t, p values, and effect sizes (d).",

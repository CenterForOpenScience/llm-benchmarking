            "notes": "All non-binary variables are transformed into logarithmic form. For such variables, the regression models estimate elasticity coefficients where the coefficient for the independent variable is the estimated net percent change in the dependent variable associated with a 1 percent increase in the independent variable. The working hours data cover all nonfarm private employees, but exclude public employees. The effect of working time on environmental outcomes is considered as a scale effect. The scale effect is measured as working time’s contribution to GDP. The authors test for the scale effect by disaggregating GDP into three parts: working hours, labor productivity, and employment to population ratio. In Model 1 they include both labor productivity and employed population percentage as the other components of GDP. Labor productivity is measured as GDP per hour of work. Employed population percentage is measured as the employed population of a state divided by its total population. The composition effect is measured net of GDP. All continuous variables are logged (ln). All models are calculated with AR(1) correction. All models contain unreported year-specific intercepts and unreported unit-specific intercept."

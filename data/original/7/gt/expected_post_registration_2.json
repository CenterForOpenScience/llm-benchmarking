      "summary": "Across fixed-effects, random-effects, and hybrid panel models, average weekly working hours are positively and significantly associated with state-level CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. In the preferred fixed-effects scale model, a 1 percent increase in average working hours per worker is associated with a 0.668 percent increase in emissions, net of productivity, employment, population, energy production, manufacturing share, household size, and working-age population. Similar positive and significant elasticities are found in other model specifications, supporting the conclusion that longer working hours contribute to higher emissions at the state level.",

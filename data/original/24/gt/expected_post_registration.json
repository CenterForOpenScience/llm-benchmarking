            "description": "In Experiment 1, participants were learning through a decision-making task. They were randomly assigned to either a contingent-information condition or a full-information condition. Then they played a beekeeping game that basically was a learning task where they decided whether to deal with or avoid a stimulus. The authors statistically compared the conditions using a Bayesian parameter estimation approach.",
            "steps": "1. Prepare the stimuli - total of 16 unique computer-generated cartoon bees that varied on four binary dimensions; two or six legs, a striped or spotted body, single or double wings, and antennae or no antennae. Two of the four dimensions were chosen as relevant, counterbalanced across participants. Of the four possible combinations of values on these two dimensions, one was chosen at random; stimuli with this combination of values were “dangerous,” and the remaining stimuli were “friendly.” 2. Follow the procedure: participants play a beekeeping game collecting honey in which they chose whether to harvest from or avoid different bee types. Only two bee features actually determined they were dangerous.  2a. Learning phase - 64 trials (16 unique bee stimuli, each presented 4 times - four blocks of 16 trials). On each trial participants choose to harvest (and gain $0.02 if bee is friendly, or lose $0.10 if dangerous) or avoid ($0.00), starting with a $0.40 bonus. Within a block, stimuli are randomized (every 8 stimuli contained 2 dangerous and 6 friendly bee varieties). Participants are split into two conditions. In the contingent condition, no feedback is provided when a participant avoids a hive. In the full-information condition, participants are informed if the bee variety is friendly or dangerous and of what the payoff would have been had they harvested the hive. 2b. Surprise test phase - a 32 trial phase in which participants encounter each variety twice and receive no feedback. The randomization procedure is like in the learning phase.  2c. After the test phase, participants are informed of their total bonus, and asked two final questions: “About what percentage of beehives do you think contained dangerous bees?” (response range 0–100%) and “Which features do you think were useful in deciding whether a bee variety was friendly or dangerous?” (any combination of the four features using check boxes). 3. Perform power analysis (for the Experiment 1 the authors' preliminary power calculations indicated that 50 participants per condition would allow us to consistently detect a difference of 30% or greater of participants falling  into the learning trap). 4. Recruit participants via Amazon Mechanical Turk (in Experiment 1 participants received $1.25 for participation and received a performance-based bonus that ranged up to $1.80). 5. Assign participants to either the contingent-information or full-information condition. 6. Run the learning phase and test phase, recording participants’ choices. 7. Exclude participants according to the criteria. In Experiment 1 two participants indicated that they used an external memory device (e.g., pen and paper) during the task, and four required more than two attempts to pass a post-instructions quiz (there are no specific information what the quiz entailed).  8. Compute the average 1D score within each condition. 9. Compare conditions using Bayesian parameter estimation. 10. Estimate the posterior distribution of the difference between condition means. 11. Calculate the 95% posterior credible interval for the difference.",

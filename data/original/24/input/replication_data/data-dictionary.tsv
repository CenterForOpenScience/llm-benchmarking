Variable	Variable Name	Measurement Unit	Allowed Values	Description
success	SUCCESS	bool	TRUE or FALSE or NA	Whether all image files were successfully preloaded for the subject.
trial_type	TRIAL_TYPE	string	varies	The jsPsych plugin used to run the trial.
trial_index	TRIAL_INDEX	int	integers >= 0	The trial index for the trial.
time_elapsed	TIME_ELAPSED	milliseconds	strictly increasing set of integers for each subject	The total time elapsed by the end of the trial since the start of the experiment.
internal_node_id	INTERNAL_NODE_ID	string	varies	This is used internally by jsPsych to find data. Not relevant to analysis.
subject_id	SUBJECT_ID	string	varies	Originally, the prolific ID of the subject. This has been anonymized.
study_id	STUDY_ID	string	varies	The prolific study ID.
session_id	SESSION_ID	string	varies	The prolific session ID.
condition	CONDITION	string	full-information or contingent	Which condition the participant was assigned to.
relevant_dimensions	RELEVANT_DIMENSIONS	string	any two of "antennae" "wings" "pattern" and "legs"	A list of the two features that are category-relevant
bee_group.antennae	ANTENNAE	string	A or B or X	The bee group variables specify which types of bees are dangerous. If X, then this feature is not relevant. A = antennae, B = bald
bee_group.wings	WINGS	string	1 or 2 or X	The bee group variables specify which types of bees are dangerous. If X, then this feature is not relevant. 1= 1 pair of wings, 2 = 2 pairs of wings
bee_group.pattern	PATTERN	string	S or D or X	The bee group variables specify which types of bees are dangerous. If X, then this feature is not relevant. S = stripes, D = dots
bee_group.legs	LEGS	string	F or M or X	The bee group variables specify which types of bees are dangerous. If X, then this feature is not relevant. F = few, M = many
bonus	BONUS	US dollars	0-2	The amount of bonus this participant earned.
timeout	TIMEOUT	bool	TRUE or FALSE or NA	For the preloading trials, whether the experiment timed out before preloading was successful.
failed_images	FAILED_IMAGES	string	varies	Specifies a list of image files that failed to load if success is false.
failed_audio	FAILED_AUDIO	string	empty list	Specifies audio files that failed to preload. Not relevant to this experiment.
failed_video	FAILED_VIDEO	string	empty list	Specifies video files that failed to preload. Not relevant to this experiment.
rt	RT	milliseconds	numbers > 0	The response time of the subject in milliseconds for that trial
stimulus	STIMULUS	string	varies	A representation of the stimulus shown on the screen. Usually an HTML-formatted string or path to an image file
response	RESPONSE	string	varies	For the bee harvesting trials, 0 = harvest & 1 = avoid. 
view_history	VIEW_HISTORY	string	varies	Shows the time spent on each page of the instructions for the instructions plugin trials. Also shows if the participant went backwards to review the instructions
question_order	QUESTION_ORDER	int	varies	Records the order that questions were asked. Since question order was not randomized in this experiment it is not relevant.
correct	CORRECT	bool	TRUE or FALSE or NA	For the instructions quiz, records TRUE if all answers are correct, FALSE otherwise.
action	ACTION	string	avoid or harvest or NA	For the learning phase, records the action the participant took on each trial
summary	SUMMARY	string	good-avoid or good-harvest or bad-avoid or bad-harvest	For the learning phase, records the value of the action and action together.
subject	SUBJECT	string	varies	A randomly generated subject ID. Redundant with the subject_id column.

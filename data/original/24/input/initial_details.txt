[CLAIM]
The 95% posterior credible intervals (CI) for the difference between the conditions excluded zero: participants in the contingent-information condition had an average 1D score of .83, while those in the full-information condition had an average score of .75, CI = [.03, .14]

[HYPOTHESES]
Participants in the contingent feedback condition will adopt an inferior one-dimension categorization strategy more often than participants in the full-information condition.

Construct the key predictor “concern about immigration” as an index averaging three reversed-coded items (economic effect, cultural effect, overall effect on country).\n5.Add individual-level control variables: \n-Unhappiness: reversed 0–10 scale.\n-Dissatisfaction with life: reversed 0–10 scale.\n-Frequency of meeting friends: reversed 1–7 scale (such that high values represent rarely meeting with friends).\n-Interpersonal distrust: reversed 0–10 scale, index of three items (questions about general trust, fairness, and helpfulness of people).\n-Dissatisfied with country’s economy: reversed 0–10 scale.\n-Dissatisfied with personal income: reversed 0–10 scale.\n-Dissatisfied with health and education system: reversed 0–10 scales.\n-Winner effect: 1 if voted for governing party, 0 otherwise.\n-Vote for far-right party: 1 if respondent voted for anti-immigration party, 0 otherwise.\n-Left-right scale.\n-Household income (standardized across rounds).\n-Age.\n-Education.\n-Gender (0 = male, 1 = female).\n7.Estimate a three-level hierarchical linear model with individuals nested within country-rounds and countries using HLM software.",

Data limitations prevented authors from predicting actual turnover, but turnover intention and actual turnover are usually highly and positively correlated in research. Gender data would have been an appropriate demographic variable to include but was missing for approximately 140,000 respondents so it was excluded from analysis."

They measured turnover intention as a dichotomous variable (1  = those who plan to leave their agency to take another job within the federal government, 0 = all others) and labelled it Leaving Agency.\n4.

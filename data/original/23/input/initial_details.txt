[CLAIM]
To test the claim, participants evaluated
eight products (four utilitarian products and four symbolic products), with product order
counterbalanced and symbolic and utilitarian products intermixed. A 2 (level:
category or brand) × 2 (unbranded product type: utilitarian or symbolic) mixed ANOVA on the
difference scores (averaged for each product type) revealed the predicted level × product type
interaction (F(1, 204) = 7.70, p = 0.006).

[HYPOTHESES]
products predominantly associated with utilitarian attitudes at the product category level support less utilitarian and more symbolic attitudes at the brand level, while products predominantly associated with symbolic attitudes at the product category level support less symbolic and more utilitarian attitudes at the brand level

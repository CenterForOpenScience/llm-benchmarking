            "steps": "1. Extract internet jokes from humor hubs, (Facebook pages posting entertaining contents (>10k followers)), and humorous strips. Divide them into related to Covid-19 or not (NonCovid Verbal serve as baseline and included miscellaneous themes, generally softer and benign). 2. Divide Covid-19 humor further into three types: Covid Verbal (n=12), Covid Meme (n=6), and Covid Strip (n=6). 3. Create the survey using the jokes (ask participants to rate each humor item for funniness and aversiveness on two 7-point scales from 0 to 6).  4. Add demographics (Age, Gender, Provenance) questions, psychological distance questions (perceived risk of Covid-19 infection on 1–10 scale, social distance as number of known Covid-19 cases among friends/relatives). 5. Add personality measures: Coping Humor Scale (CHS) and Life Orientation Test – Revised (LOTR). 6. Recruit participants via social media, targeted Facebook ads, public communication, and email and present them with the survey. First, they will provide informed consent and demographics (Age, Gender and Provenance), then complete a section with psychological distance questions, the personality assessment, and then they will be asked to rate each item for funniness and aversiveness on two 7-point scales ranging from 0 (not at all funny/disturbing) to 6 (very funny/disturbing) 7. Calculate spatial distance as the geodesic distance (in kilometers) between the epicenter of the Italian outbreak (Codogno) and the municipality where each participant completed the questionnaire. 8. After collecting and cleaning the data, fit Linear Mixed Models in R with crossed random effects for Participants, Items, and Province, building four increasingly complex models for each outcome and comparing goodness of fit.",

The sample is representative of public elementary school students. English achievement was assessed with a Cloze test, scaled using one-parameter item response theory in ConQuest with weighted likelihood estimates (WLEs; mean = 100, SD = 20). General cognitive abilities were measured using a composite score from two subtests of the CFT4-12R (verbal and figural analogies). All analyses used five imputed datasets to replace missing values, based on a background model including individual-level factors (grades, self-concept, interest, motivation) and classroom-level factors (achievement, socio-economic status, percentage of students with immigration background). Results were combined using MPlus 5.21 with type = imputation."

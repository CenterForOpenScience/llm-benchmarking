      "statement": "After adjusting for general cognitive abilities, age, gender, socio-economic status, parental education, and cultural capital, membership in the bilingual group is positively related to English foreign language achievement: bilingual students score about 2.68 points higher than monolinguals on the English scale, and this effect is statistically significant.",

The analytic sample includes a monolingual German group (n = 1,896) and several bilingual groups (Arabic–German, Chinese–German, Polish–German, Turkish–German, and a heterogeneous ‘other bilingual’ group). Missing data were handled via multiple imputation (five imputed datasets), and analyses accounted for the clustering of students within classes using complex survey procedures in Mplus 5.21."

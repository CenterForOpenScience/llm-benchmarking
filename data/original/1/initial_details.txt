[CLAIM]
An interquartile increase in support for Trump (I.Q.R. = 20.3%) resulted in a 4.1 percentage point decrease in social distancing (95% C.I. = 3.0–5.2) [ p < 0.001].

[HYPOTHESES]
At the level of U.S. counties, support for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election will be negatively associated with social distancing behavior.

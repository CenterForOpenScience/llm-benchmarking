we found a significanteffect of the clarity  x ratingdistribution interaction on desirability (M_Bimodal/Clear = 3.8 vs.M_Bimodal/Conflicted =4.2 vs.M_Unimodal/Clear = 4.2 vs.M_Unimodal/Conflicted = 3.7; b = –.17, SE = .08, t(123)-= –2.15, p = .03

[HYPOTHESES]
People find products with bimodal ratings more desirable when they experience temporary low self-concept clarity, such that there will be a significant effect of the clarity x rating predictor in the regression, reflecting a ‘crossover’ effect such that Bimodal/Clear and Unimodal/Conflicted show lower desirability ratings than Unimodal/Clear and Bimodal/Conflicted

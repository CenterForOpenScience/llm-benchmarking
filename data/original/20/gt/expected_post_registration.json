They checked the psychometric properties of the scale and tested how each threat predicted wellbeing and adherence to public-health behaviors.",
            "steps": "1.The authors recruited U.S. participants via MTurk and administered baseline survey at time T1. 2.They they administered the 10-item Integrated COVID-19 Threat Scale to measure realistic and symbolic threat. 3. Next, they assessed the factor structure and longitudinal invariance of the threat scale (Study 3). 4. They contacted participants one week later (time T2) and administered psychological distress (Beck anxiety scale, COVID-19 impact intrusion and COVID-19 impact avoidance scales), psychological well-being (general satisfaction with life using Diener’s five-item scale, PANAS short form), and attitudinal and behavioral responses to COVID-19 (compliance with the Center for Infectious Diseases guidelines, support for restrictive policies to prevent COVID-19, and social identity affirming behaviors in isolation). 5. Next, they scored scales according to instrument instructions (means for most measures; summed scores for Beck Anxiety Inventory, PANAS, and COVID-19 impact scales). 6. Finally, the authors estimated structural equation model (SEM) predicting all T2 outcomes simultaneously from T1 realistic and symbolic threat variables and allowing predictors and outcomes to covary within the SEM framework to capture interrelations among outcomes.",

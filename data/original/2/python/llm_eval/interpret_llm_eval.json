    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The JSON mentions full alignment with minor deviations, which is mostly similar to the reference document's description of the analytic script revisions and dataset differences."

  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact is described as low in the JSON, which is mostly similar to the reference document's indication that the errors were corrected and did not prevent obtaining results."

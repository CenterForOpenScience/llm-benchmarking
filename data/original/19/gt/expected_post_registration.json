According to the government efficiency metric, efficient governments score highly on 5 dimensions: they are efficient in spending public revenue, they do not place strong compliance burdens on the private sector, they are able to efficiently settle legal and judicial disputes in the private sector, they are receptive to challenges from the private sector, and they offer transparent information about changes in government policies and regulations affecting private sector 5 activities. The mortality likelihood was measured through the number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by the number of COVID-19 cases in a nation. Economic development was indexed through GDP per capita, Inequality was indexed through the nations’ Gini coefficients."

Calculate the infection rate per million citizens for each day.\n3. Capture infection rate by fitting regression equations for each nation, log-transforming the outcome variable (cases per million people) and the predictor variable (days) to account for the exponential growth rate of the virus.\n4. Get government efficiency and cultural tightness data.\n5. Combine nation-level growth rate estimates with government efficiency and cultural tightness scores.\n6. Add and standardize control variables.\n7. Examine the distribution of the rate of cases and mortality likelihood before fitting the models like the authors did. They discovered that the growth rate of cases was normally distributed, but the mortality likelihood was highly skewed. If the distribution is similar, proceed to steps 8 and 9. If not, choose a model that better fits the data’s distributional characteristics.\n8. Conduct weighted ordinary least squares regression predicting log-transformed COVID-19 infection rate per million, including both main effects of cultural tightness and government efficiency and their interaction.\n9. Weight each nation’s observation by the number of days of data available to account for reliability.",

      "hypothesis": "Countries with stronger social norms (greater cultural tightness) and more capable public institutions (greater government efficiency) will experience slower COVID-19 infection growth, with the slowest growth occurring where both tightness and efficiency are high.",

      "statement": "The regression results (p. 7) support the interactive prediction for infection growth: the tightness-by-efficiency interaction is negative and statistically significant, indicating that tightness is linked to slower infection growth particularly in countries with more efficient governments (and efficiency is likewise linked to slower growth particularly in tighter cultures).",

      "description": "The study first estimates country-specific COVID-19 infection growth rates from daily case-per-million time series and then uses country-level regressions to test whether cultural tightness and government efficiency—individually and interactively—predict cross-national variation in infection growth (and separately mortality likelihood), controlling for economic development, inequality, and median age.",

[CLAIM]
Nations with efficient governments and tight cultures have been most effectiveat limiting COVID-19’s infection rate and mortality likelihood (a significant interaction betweentightness and efficiency, b = -.17, SE = .07, t(41) = -2.23, p = .031).

[HYPOTHESIS]
The interaction between cultural tightness and government efficiency will be negative in its association with the COVID-19 infection rate.

[CLAIM]
The authors find that as the number of parties in the system increases, party dispersion increases and the effect is statistically significant for both policy dimensions (coefficient on log count of parties in system term = 0.39, robust SE clustered by country = 0.14, coefficient falls within a 95% confidence interval)

[HYPOTHESIS]
On the economic policy dimension, the number of parties in the party system is positively associated with policy dispersion.

[CLAIM]
Political polarization is strongly associatedwith smaller government in democratic countries, but there is no relationship between polarization and the size ofgovernment in undemocratic countries. When the sample is restricted to strong democracies, the estimated effect of polarization on government consumption is statistically significant (coefficient in the ‘long’ specification for the “Private” measure of polarization=-18.73, heteroscedasticity robust SE=4.79, p=.01)

[HYPOTHESIS]
Among strong democracies (countries with a Polity IV score of 9 or greater), polarization (as measured by the SD of the “private ownership” responses) will be negatively associated with the size of government

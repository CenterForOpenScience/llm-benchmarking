Privacy Statement: Other teams are making predictions about the outcomes of many different 
studies, not knowing which studies have been selected for replication. As a consequence, the 
success of this project requires full confidentiality of this peer review process. This includes 
privacy about which studies have been selected for replication and all aspects of the discussion 
about these replication designs. 
 
 

 
Instructions for Data Analysts 
 
The preregistration for this replication study was started by a separate team of researchers who were 
responsible for identifying data sources and constructing them into a replication dataset(s) for your use in 
the analysis. They have completed sections 1-13 of the preregistration below, and included additional 
materials in the OSF project that document how the dataset was constructed.  
 
In cases where all of the underlying data sources were able to be freely shared and posted, the 
constructed dataset(s) have been posted to the OSF as well, which you are free to use in designing the 
analysis plan (see below for details). In cases where some or all of the data sources could ​not​ be freely 
shared or posted, the replication dataset(s) are not provided on the OSF. Rather, you will need to follow 
the instructions and code to first reconstruct the datasets, and then proceed with your work. In such 
cases, the team responsible for creating the dataset(s) has provided summary statistics in the OSF that 
correspond to the constructed datasets, so you can verify that the datasets you create match what they 
intended. 
 
You’ll be responsible for filling out sections 16-25 of the preregistration below. Before you do so, ​please 
review the original study, sections 1-15 of the preregistration, and the materials provided on the 
OSF​, so that you are familiar with all of the decisions that have been made to date. In many cases, the 
‘data preparer’ will have left you instructions and suggestions on how the provided data can be used in 
the analysis, as well as idiosyncrasies and discrepancies in the data that you should be aware of. The 
data preparers have tried to be thorough in including all variables that you might need, but please keep in 
mind the following: 
●
Some of the variables included in the constructed dataset(s) may not be needed in the final 
analysis, so please do not feel the need to necessarily use all of the provided variables. 
●
Some of the variables needed might have mistakenly been excluded from the constructed 
datasets. If you find that this is the case, please let ​Andrew​ or ​Anna​ know, and they will work with 
you to supplement the datasets as needed. 
 
For these secondary data replications, we would like the analysis plan to be completed before the 
preregistration goes through review, so that after review, the only remaining steps are registration and 
running the analysis code on the full datasets. To facilitate that, we are asking that you include in section 
19 a link to the code you will use that takes the constructed dataset(s) provided to you and produces the 
focal analysis (including all of the cleaning, merging, and transforming required). ​When developing your 
analysis plan and code, please randomly sample 5% of the data for use in your work and demonstrate 
that the focal analysis produces sensible results using just that random sample (see section 19 for 
details). ​Do not use the rest of the data until after your study is registered and it is time to run the 
final analysis​.​ In section 19, you will find a statement that we are asking you to bold that confirms you’ve 
only used 5% of the data when developing and testing your code. If this approach will not work for any 
reason, please let ​Andrew​ or ​Anna​ know and disclose deviations from this plan somewhere in the 
preregistration. 
●
In cases where we are providing you a complete dataset, you can just sample out 5% of the 
observations and hold the rest out until you are ready to perform the final analysis. 
●
In cases where we are providing you multiple datasets that need to be combined prior to analysis, 
please sample out 5% of the observations in whatever way is most sensible.  
○
For example, in cases where each dataset contains complete observations on its own (a 
typical 'row bind' situation), it makes the most sense to sample out 5% of each dataset 
separately and then combine them together to develop and test your code.  

 
○
In cases where datasets need to be merged in order to create complete observations (a 
typical 'column bind' situation), it makes the most sense to merge the separate datasets 
into a full dataset first, and then sample out the 5% before proceeding with the rest of the 
analysis code. 
●
We leave the decision on how to sample out the random subset of data to you, so long as (a) you 
are not performing any analyses on the complete dataset until after your study is registered and 
(b) whatever decision you make is documented in the preregistration. 
 
Finally, in cases where the replication data combines observations from the original study with 
observations that were not used in the original study (what we are calling ‘hybrid replications’), please 
perform up to three analyses (details immediately below). This will likely require you to subset your data, 
based on the description of the original analysis provided in the study. 
●
When the ‘new’ data alone can clear the minimum power threshold, please perform one analysis 
that relies only on the ‘new data’ (the focal analysis), one analysis that relies on all available data, 
and a third analysis that relies only on the original data. Please make sure all three analyses are 
documented (with code) in section 19 below. 
●
When the ‘new’ data alone ​cannot​ clear the minimum power threshold, please perform one 
analysis that combines all available data, and a second that only uses the old data. Please make 
sure both analyses are documented (with code) in section 19 below. 
 
Please contact ​Andrew​ or ​Anna​ if you have any questions. After you’ve completed the remaining 
sections of the preregistration and uploaded all the necessary materials to the OSF, please 
contact ​the SCORE coordinators​ regarding next steps.

Study Information 
1. Title (provided by SCORE) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: ​This has been determined by SCORE​. 
 
Replication of a research claim from Hossain (2020). 
 
2. Authors and affiliations  
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: ​Fill in the names and affiliations of your team below​. 
 
Carolin Nast A​1

2 Central Bank of Costa Rica 
3. Description of study (provided by SCORE) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: ​This description has been provided by SCORE. Please review and 
make a SCORE project coordinator aware of any edits, additions, and corrections you would 
suggest to the paragraph. You are free to add additional descriptions of your project in a 
separate paragraph.  
 
The claim selected for replication from Hossain (2020) is that  ​a cohesive society where people 
are involved in more festivals and religious gatherings is more likely to have more cases of 
COVID-19.​This reflects the following statements from the paper's abstract: ​The estimation results 
indicate that the number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus infection is higher in countries with lower 
yearly average temperature, higher economic openness and stronger political democracy. The 
description of the analysis is as follows: ‘By estimating a regression equation where the dependent 
variable is the total number of cases confirmed infection per one million people in a country on a day 
(03 April 2020) and the predictor variables are the democracy index of the country (the proxy 
variable for social cohesiveness), the yearly average temperature of the country, and the openness 
of the country (measured by international trade as a percentage of GDP)...We apply Least Squares 
method on model (1) and find that precipitation and population density have no significant effect on 
the number of infection cases per one million people (Y). Those variables are then excluded, and the 
model is re-estimated. In the re-estimated model, the variables average temperature, openness and 
democracy appear as highly significant.’ The focal finding is: ‘The positive sign of democracy index 

 
indicates that more democratic countries are affected more by the disease. From Table 1: model 1 
coefficient = 86.76467, p = 0.0001.’ 
 
4. Hypotheses (provided by SCORE with possible Data Analyst additions) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​The focal test for SCORE is indicated as H*. If you will test 
additional hypotheses (or use alternate analyses) that help you to evaluate the claim your 
replication/reproduction is testing, number them H1, H2, H3 etc. (You can place H* in the list 
wherever makes sense). Please make sure that any additional hypotheses are logical 
deductions/operationalizations of the selected SCORE claim or are necessary to properly 
interpret the focal H* hypothesis.  Research that is outside this scope should be described in a 
separate preregistration. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the ​Reviewer Criteria​): 
●
Are the listed hypotheses specific, concise, clearly testable, and specified at the level of 
operationalized variables?  
●
Are hypotheses identified as directional or non-directional, and, if applicable, have the 
direction of hypotheses been stated? (Example: “Customers’ mean choice satisfaction 
will be​ ​higher in the CvSS architecture condition than in the standard attribute-by- 
attribute architecture condition.”) 
●
Does the list of hypotheses/tests indicate whether additional hypotheses are taken from 
the original study or modified/added by the team? 
 
H*:​  At the country level, the democracy index will be positively associated with the total number 
of confirmed infections per one million people. 
 
 

 
Design Plan 
5. Study type 
NOTE:​ ​The study type selected should be based on the data collected for the replication, and 
not necessarily the data used in the original study. 
 
●
Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes 
field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes 
randomized controlled trials. 
●
Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly 
assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, natural experiments, and 
regression discontinuity designs. 
●
Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies. 
●
Other  
6. Blinding 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​Select any/all of the below that apply for your study by bolding 
them. You will give a longer description in the next question. 
 
●
No blinding is involved in this study. 
●
For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which 
they have been assigned. 
●
Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human 
subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments. (Commonly known as “double 
blind”) 
●
Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the treatment 
applied to any given group. 
 
[QUESTION 6 - BOLD YOUR RESPONSE ABOVE] 
 
7. Blinding 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​Since all existing data replications are based on data that has 
already been collected, in most cases it will not be necessary to comment on participant 
blinding. In the rare instance when an existing experiment is being re-analyzed for an existing 
data replication and blinding is a relevant consideration, please provide below any details 
regarding blinding that are important for a reviewer to be aware of. 
 
No blinding was involved to the data finders knowledge.  
 

 
8. Study Design 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​Please describe how data was collected in the original study and 
how it compares to the data that was selected for the replication attempt. Explain why the data 
selected for the replication study is suitable for a replication and if any substantial deviations 
exist between the two. 
 
If the data used in the replication combines observations from the original study with new 
observations (e.g. if the data selected for the replication attempt comes from the same 
longitudinal survey as the original study), describe how ‘original’ and ‘new’ observations relate to 
each other and an estimate for what proportion of the final dataset’s observations will be 
comprised of original vs. new observations. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the ​Reviewer Criteria​): 
●
Does the preregistration specify the unit of analysis? 
●
Does the preregistration provide sufficient detail about how the data selected for the 
replication attempt deviates from or is congruent with the data employed in the original 
study? 
●
Does the preregistration describe whether and how ‘original’ and ‘new observations’ are 
combined together for the replication dataset? 
 
The original study is investigating the relationship between the severity of the COVID-19 
disease and the environmental, economic and social factors of countries. The data used for the 
analysis are publicly available. The study combines different data sources:  
 
1.
Coronavirus infection cases along with population in 2018 are collected from the website 
of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). 
2.
Average yearly temperature data were collected from meteoblue.com. 
3.
Average precipitation data were collected from indexmundi.com. 
4.
Openness data as defined by ratio of international trade to GDP from Databank of the 
World Bank.  
5.
Scores of democracy index 2019, compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit, UK, is 
collected from Wikipedia.  
6.
Population density (data source is not mentioned).  
 
The dependent variable, severity of the COVID-19 disease, is calculated by counting the 
infection cases for all countries from 31 December 2019 until 03 April 2020. This number of total 
cases per country is converted to cases per one million population. The focal analysis for 
replication does not include the independent variables of population density and average 
precipitation.  
 

 
From the original study: “Total number of cases of Coronavirus infection by countries is time 
variant. The number accumulates over time. Nonetheless, total cases of infection in a specific 
country on a specific day (Y) is a fixed number. Thus, the variable, total cases of infection by 
countries has both time series and cross-section elements. We collect data on total infection 
cases by countries from 31 December 2019 to 03 April 2020. Total cases of infection are 
converted to cases per one million population to capture the population effect. Cases of 
infection per one million people on 03 April 2020 by countries are denoted by Y and used as the 
dependent variable in our experimentation. Values of this variable obviously depend on its 
previous values. Consequently, Y is simultaneously a cross-section and time series variable.” 
(p. 10).  
 
The author states that he cannot include all countries infected by COVID-19 in the analysis due 
to unavailability of all data for few countries. In total, 163 countries are included in this analysis 
(p. 10). It is not mentioned which countries specifically.  
 
The replication dataset contains three versions of the COVID variable. One version covering the 
total dates available (December 31 2019 - August 11 2020).  A second version covers the dates 
from the original study (December 31 2019 - April 03 2020). A third version covers the dates 
that have occurred since the original study (April 04 - August 11). Similar to the original study, 
all independent variables are included in the replication dataset.  
 
9. Randomization (free response) 
 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​If the variables used for this replication attempt were randomized, 
state how they were randomized, and at what level. 
 
No randomization was applied to the data finders knowledge.  
Sampling Plan 
 
This section describes how the data sources for the replication were selected, how they were 
prepared into a replication dataset, and the number of observations that will be analyzed from 
these data. Please keep in mind that the data described in this section are the actual data used 
for analysis, so if you are using a subset of a larger dataset, please describe the subset that will 
actually be used in your study. 
10. Existing data 
1.1.1.
Registration prior to creation of data 
1.1.2.
Registration prior to any human observation of the data 

 
1.1.3.
Registration prior to accessing the data 
1.1.4.
Registration prior to analysis of the data 
1.1.5.
Registration following analysis of the data 
 
11. Explanation of existing data 
NOTE:​ ​For replications that rely on existing data sources, this question refers to the data that 
will be used for the replication analysis (i.e. the final replication dataset), and not (a) the data 
from the original study or (b) the data sources accessed to construct the replication dataset. 
Since no new data will be created for ‘existing data replications,’ 1.1.1 should never be selected. 
Since all analyses will occur after registration, 1.1.5 should also never be selected. 
 
The raw datasets for replication have been accessed, cleaned and one variable has been 
manipulated (Openness, see 12c). The final replication dataset includes all variables needed for 
analysis. The variables in the final dataset correspond to the constructs used in the original 
study, however, two variables have been collected from a different data source (see 12c). The 
data analyst has to calculate the final dependent variable, COVID cases per 1 million 
population.  
 
The final replication dataset can be found here: ​https://osf.io/6cq9b/  
12. Data collection procedures 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​Please describe the process for constructing the replication 
dataset in as much detail as you can. The sections below should be used to provide the 
following information: 
●
Which variables are needed from the original study to perform a good-faith, high-quality 
replication.  
●
Which data sources were used, why they were selected, any deviations between the 
original study design and the replication study design that these selections present, and 
the procedures used to access the data. 
●
Which of the variables from the original study are available in the replication data 
sources, including relevant details about each measure. 
●
The procedure for creating the replication dataset, in both narrative and script form. 
●
A data dictionary that documents each variable included in the replication dataset. 
 
In the sections below, please provide links to the original materials whenever possible -- 
including descriptions of the original datasets and corresponding codebooks. If materials can be 
shared on the OSF, please do so, and provide view-only links to those materials. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind for reviewers: 
●
Does the preregistration describe which data sources were selected for the replication 
study and why each is suitable? 

 
●
Does the preregistration make clear how the data sources were used to construct the 
replication dataset? 
(a) Data Needed 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​List below the datasets and variables the original author used to 
analyze the focal claim. Include details regarding the sample size, waves or years used, and 
other details pertinent to finding an existing dataset for replication. Please include page 
numbers when excerpting from the original article. If possible, categorize the list of variables as 
one of the following: dependent variable, focal independent variable, control variable, or sample 
parameters/clustering variable. Finally, include the sample size of the original study’s focal 
analysis, if it is available. 
 
The unit of analysis of the original study are 163 countries.  
 
Dependent variable:  
Coronavirus infection cases 
●
Datasource: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 
●
The dependent variable, severity of the COVID-19 disease, is calculated by counting the 
infection cases for all countries from 31 December 2019 until 03 April 2020. This number 
of total cases per country is converted to cases per one million population. 
 
Independent variables:  
Environmental variables 
Average yearly temperature  
●
Yearly average temperature (averaged for the years 1961-1990) 
●
Data source: meteoblue.com (as indicated in the original paper on p. 9) 
●
Further note: The original author sent the SCORE team some clarification about this 
variable and provided the original data. I, the data finder, strongly guess that the author 
used the yearly average temperature data from Wikipedia and not as indicated in the 
original paper from the website meteoblue. Please see the screenshot I uploaded to the 
OSF project (Link: ​https://osf.io/tkdfs/​ ). The source given by Wikipedia for their data is 
the Lebanese-economy-forum. Here is the citation (with link) from Wikipedia: “​Average 
yearly temperature (1961-1990, Celsius) - by country"​. ​lebanese-economy-forum.com​.

meteoblue website and could not find this historical weather data the author claims to 
have used. Due to the questionable reliability of data retrieved from Wikipedia, I have 
included comparable historical weather data from the World Bank (as the World Bank is 
a very reliable data source). For further information see Variable Availability.

(b) Data Access 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​  ​Describe below the data sources that will provide the replication 
variables. Include information such as the name of the data source (e.g., Indonesian Family Life 
Survey), the description and link of the data source, and the waves needed to create a final 
replication dataset.  
 
Also describe the process for accessing the data sources that will be used to create the final 
replication dataset; specify how long long it took for the registration to be approved and what 
information was required (e.g., writeup of the purpose of the project, email address from an 
IPCSR institution, etc.); and verify that the data can be opened as expected. If applicable, 
provide a link to the page where you registered to access the data. 
 
Describe in detail any restrictions on data access and data-sharing, as well as any additional 
terms of data use that will be relevant for the replication study and final report (e.g. citations that 
will need to be made). If you were able to access the data because of special permissions that 
you have, but that you expect other researchers might not have, please document those as well. 
 
The data sources for replication are (nearly) the same as in the original study (two variables are 
collected from a different datasource, see Variable Availability). The data is freely available for 
research purposes and offers a very user-friendly platform. The data files have been 
successfully downloaded. No registration is needed to download the necessary data.

(c) Variable Availability 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: ​For each variable required for the replication analysis (listed 
above), describe the variables from the replication data that can be used to measure it 
(including which data files or sources each measure is found in), ​any notes a data analyst 
should consider when using the measure in a replication analysis​, and any important 
differences between the original variable and the proposed replication variable. 
 
If there are multiple variables in the replication data that correspond to a required variable (e.g. 
two different measures of education in the replication data), include all of those options below. If 
a variable from the original study ​cannot​ be measured using the replication data, please make 
that clear as well. ​Finally, include a description of the identifiers used to merge multiple 
datasets, if applicable.

The confirmed COVID cases are included in three versions in the replication dataset, 
covering three different time frames (see below).

The data analyst has to calculate the total cases per country per 1 million population. For 
this reason population data is also retrieved from ECDC.

Difference to original study: The original study used data on the annual temperature 
based on historical data, averaged for the years 1961 to 1990, while the variable 
included in the replication dataset used annual temperature, averaged for the years 
1961 to 1999).  
 
 
Economic and social variables 
Openness

Further note: The author does not specify for which year he collected this variable from 
the World Bank. The World Bank trade data is available from 1960-2019. Due to the fact 
that a significant number of countries did not have a value for 2019, I decided to include 
the most recent value within the time frame of 2015 - 2019 (variable trade.recent). This 

 
means that the value is either imputed from 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, or that the value 
was available for 2019. I decided not to include older values in order to guarantee 
validity. To make this imputation transparent, I created a variable called imputed.trade, 
which indicates if international trade value is from 2019 (0), or was imputed (1) (variable 
imputed.trade). I also uploaded the original dataset, so that the data analyst can change 
the above explained imputation if necessary. Additionally, I followed the suggestion of 
the SCORE team and included another variable (trade.2016) that refers to international 
trade in 2016 for all available countries. This year was chosen because it is the most 
recent year for which the most number of countries have valid responses. The data 
analyst has to decide which variable to use for the openness construct.

(d) Data Creation 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​Create a dataset using the data sources and variables listed 
above. Provide a detailed narrative describing how the various datasets were cleaned and 
merged into a final replication dataset. Provide a view-only link to a clearly commented script on 
the OSF that produces the replication data as described in the narrative. Our preference is that 
this be either an R script or a script from another language that similarly allows for open and 
reproducible analyses. Please let the SCORE team know if this is not possible. 
●
If the data can be freely shared and posted to OSF, please post it in your OSF project 
and provide a link to the completed dataset below. 
●
If any part of the dataset cannot be shared between researchers or posted to the OSF, 
please leave the final dataset off the OSF. Instead, include either below or in your script 
(commented out at the bottom) two pieces of information that will help an independent 
team verify they have created the dataset according to your instructions: 
○
The dimensions of the final dataset(s) you’ve created (# of rows, # of columns) 
○
A summary of 8-10 variables in the replication dataset. For numeric variables, the 
summary should include the mean, standard deviation, and count of NAs. For 
categorical variables, the summary should include each level present in the data 

 
and its count, as well as a count of NAs. If multiple datasets are submitted as part 
of your work, at least one variable should be included from each dataset. 
 
The data from the replication sources should be preserved in as ‘raw’ a form as possible, in 
order to give the data analyst the most latitude to clean the variables as they see fit. Variables 
from the original source should be preserved in their original form (e.g. do not recode values of 
99 to NA). New variables should only be created when they’re needed to complete the merge or 
combine the datasets; in those cases, please preserve a version of the original, unaltered 
variable in the new dataset.  
 
Please also use this section to describe: 
●
Any deviations between the original study design and the replication design that would 
result from using this replication dataset. 
●
Any notes about using these variables that you would like to pass along to the data 
analyst. 
 
The attached uncompiled R-notebook script is very detailed in its sections and can be found 
here: ​https://osf.io/6xgeh/  
 
The final replication dataset can be found here: ​https://osf.io/6cq9b/  
 
The data analyst has to compute the following final dependent variable:  
●
COVID cases per 1 million population ​(see Variable Availability) 
 
Additionally, I want to point out the imputation approach explained in Variable Availability 
concerning the variable Openness again. The data analyst can either follow this approach (most 
recent international trade data from 2015-2019), use the alternative variable that includes 
international trade data only for the year 2016, or use the original data provided.  
 
The original Annual Average Temperature data from the World Bank can be found here:

(e) Data Dictionary 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS​: ​Create ​a data dictionary​ following ​this template​. Provide below a 
view-only link to the completed data dictionary included in the OSF project. If the Data Analyst 
will need to create new variables using the variables in the final replication dataset (e.g. 
recoding the provided education variable to be in a better format for analysis), please document 
below your recommendation on how the analyst should do so. Please also document any 
additional notes regarding the variables in the dataset that do not fit within the provided data 
dictionary template or the other sections above. 
 
The data dictionary can be found here: ​https://osf.io/u2x6b/  
 
13. Sample size 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS​: ​Please report below the analytic sample size(s) in the replication 
dataset, with reference to however many units or levels are in the data. Please report as much 
information here as will be helpful for the review committee to be aware of, including differences 
in sample size resulting from various analytic decisions (e.g. listwise deletion vs multiple 
imputation). ​Finally, when ​the replication combines observations from the original study 
with new observations​, please ​estimate what proportion of the analytic sample’s 
observations will be comprised of original vs. new observations. 
 
Data finders’ response goes here: 
 
The unit of analysis of the original study are 163 countries. It is not clear which countries were 
specifically included in the original analysis. Countries with any missing value for COVID cases, 
population, temperature, openness, or democracy index, are deleted from the replication 
dataset. After listwise deletion, the replication dataset includes 150 countries. This difference of 
13 countries compared to the original study can potentially be explained by the use of a different 
data source for the variable Average yearly temperature (world bank instead of wikipedia), and 
the years used for the imputation of the Openness (international trade) variable (see 12c). Both 
of these aspects are not stated/explained in the original study. In order to find out the exact 
reasons, a list of countries included in the original study is necessary.  
 
 
------ 
 
Required sample size [to be filled out by the SCORE team]: The primary unit of analysis is the 
country. An estimate of the minimum viable sample size for the data analytic replication is: 38. 
For comparison, the stage1 required sample size would be: 126 and the stage2 sample size 
would be: 188. 
 

 
14. Sample size rationale 
 
For data analytic replications in SCORE, three sample sizes are calculated: 
●
A minimum threshold sample size, defined as the sample size required for 50% power of 
100% of the original effect 
●
A stage 1 sample size, defined as the sample size needed to have 90% power to detect 
75% of the original effect 
●
A stage 2 sample size, defined as the sample size needed to have 90% power to detect 
50% of the original effect 
 
Details about how those sample sizes were calculated for this project are found here: 
https://osf.io/nkubx/?view_only=c48bded349914d1cae1318aeef0f5ded 
15. Stopping rule (provided by SCORE) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:  
 
There are three potential analyses that could be performed with the provided data, and 
SCORE recommends performing at least two of them: 
●
The focal analysis that relies only on dates not covered by the original study. 
●
An additional analysis that relies on all available dates. 
●
An optional third analysis that relies only on dates covered by the original study. 
Variables 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​The preregistration form divides variables across three questions: 
manipulated variables, measured variables, and indices (i.e. analytic variables derived from raw 
variables). For existing data replications, only fill out the “Measured variables’ and ‘Indices’ 
sections. Please do not fill out anything in the ‘Manipulated variables’ section.  
 
The raw data of any transformed variable (e.g. reaction time → log reaction time) or any created 
index should be defined in the ‘Measured variables’ section. Details regarding the variable 
transformation should be specified in the ‘Transformations’ section. Details regarding the 
creation of an index should be specified in the ‘Indices’ section.  
 
Across these questions, you should define all variables that will later be used during your 
analysis (including data preparation/processing). You can describe all variables in the 
preregistration and/or summarize and link to a ​data dictionary​ (codebook) in your repository to 
answer these questions. 
 

 
If you will share data from your replication, this is also the place to state whether any variables 
will be removed prior to sharing the dataset (e.g. to reduce risk of participant identification or 
comply with copyright restrictions on scale items.)  
 
16. Manipulated variables 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​Manipulated variables in this preregistration refer specifically to 
variables that have been randomly assigned in an experiment. The use of data from an 
experiment should be rare in existing data replications. If your existing data replication relies on 
experimental data, please document each manipulated variable as a measured variable, and 
use the codebook to indicate what each level of the variable corresponds to (e.g. participants 
assigned to the treatment condition = 1; participants assigned to the control condition = 0). The 
default language in bold below has been copied into all existing data replication preregistrations.  
 
N/A -- not documented for existing data replications. 
 
17. Measured variables 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​Please use this section to document each variable that was used 
in the original study’s analysis and the role it served (e.g. dependent variable, control variable, 
sample parameter, etc). For each variable, provide the description of the variable offered in the 
paper and/or codebook of the original study, the variable in the replication dataset that it 
corresponds to, and explain any deviations between the two. In cases where an equivalent 
replication variable was not found, explain how, if at all, you expect it will affect the replication 
attempt. In cases where you are adding a variable that was not present in the original study, 
please explicitly state that you are doing so, and explain how, if at all, you expect it will affect the 
replication attempt. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the ​Reviewer Criteria​): 
●
Does the preregistration surface all of the variables needed to replicate the focal 
analysis? 
●
Are deviations between the original variables and replication variables documented 
when needed? 
Note: Lines 68 to 112 of the Stata do-file “​Hossain 2020 - Replication Analysis 5% random 
sample.do​” generate the variables described below. 
 ​CASES_PER_MILLION 
●​       ​Use in the analysis: Dependent variable. 

 
●​       ​Description from the original study: “​Total cases of infection are converted to 
cases per one million population to capture the population effect​” (page 10) 
The dependent variable “Y is the total number of cases of confirmed infection per 
one million people in a country on a day (03 April 2020)” (page 11) 
While in the original study the time frame is April 03 2020, in the replication it depends 
on the type of analysis chosen. 
●​       ​Variables used in the replication: TOTAL_CASES and POPDATA2019. 
●​       ​CASES_PER_MILLION corresponds to the cases per one million population. 
●​       ​No deviations between the original study and the replication study. 
  
DEMOCRACY 
●​       ​Use in the analysis: Focal independent variable. 
●​       ​Description from the original study: In page 11, the author details the regression 
estimated in the paper. One of its control variables is the democracy index of countries, 
that in the replication analysis is the focal independent variable. 
●​       ​Variables used in the replication: DEMOCRACY. 
●​       ​DEMOCRACY corresponds to a continuous variable that expresses the quality of 
democracy as a number between 0 and 10. A higher number means a country with 
stronger political democracy.  
●​       ​No deviations between the original study and the replication study. However, it is 
important to take into consideration that while The Economist publishes the index with a 
scale from 0 to 10, Gapminder (the data source for democracy index) has converted the 
index from 0 to 100 (see 
https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/democracy-index/). Because the author 
in the original study used the scores of democracy index compiled by the Economist 
Intelligence Unit (page 9), the data obtained in Gapminder is divided by 10. 
  
TEMPERATURE 
●​       ​Use in the analysis: Control variable. 

 
●​       ​Description from the original study: In page 11, the author details the regression 
estimated in the paper. One of its control variables is the yearly average temperature of 
countries. 
●​       ​Variables used in the replication: ANNUAL_TEMP. 
●​       ​TEMPERATURE corresponds to a continuous variable representing yearly 
temperature averaged between 1961 and 1999.  
●​       ​As it is mentioned in Section 12, the original study used data on the annual 
temperature based on historical data, averaged for the years 1961 to 1990, while the 
variable included in the replication dataset used annual temperature, averaged for the 
years 1961 to 1999). 
  
OPENNESS 
●​       ​Use in the analysis: Control variable. 
●​       ​Description from the original study: In page 11, the author details the regression 
estimated in the paper. One of its control variables is openness measured by 
international trade as a percentage of GDP of countries. 
●​       ​Variables used in the replication: TRADE_2016. 
●​       ​OPENNESS corresponds to a continuous variable representing exports of goods 
and services, as a percentage of GDP. 
●
As it is explained in Section 12, it is not clear the specific year for which the author 
collected the openness variable. In the replication it is used international trade in 
2016. This year was chosen because it is the most recent year for which the most 
number of countries have valid responses. 
18. Indices 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​If any of the measured variables described in Section 17 will be 
combined into a composite measure (including simply a mean), describe in detail what 
measures you will use and how they will be combined. Please be sure this preregistration 
includes a link to a clearly commented script that constructs the index according to the narrative. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the ​Reviewer Criteria​): 
●
 Does the preregistration specify each of the composite measures (e.g. mean scores, 
factor scores) that are needed for the focal analysis, and which of the measured 

 
variables in Section 17 are used in each one (e.g. the happiness, joy, and satisfaction 
items will be used to create the ‘positive feelings’ measure)? 
●
Does the preregistration link to a clearly commented script that constructs the indices 
according to the narrative description? 
 
CASES_PER_MILLION, the dependent variable. It is constructed using the total COVID cases 
(TOTAL_CASES ) and population (POPDATA2019) variables, according to the formula 
(TOTAL_CASES /POPDATA2019)*1000000 . Lines 68 to 89 of the Stata do-file “​Hossain 2020 - 
Replication Analysis 5% random sample.do​” construct the CASES_PER_MILLION variable. 
Analysis Plan 
19. Statistical models 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​This section should describe in detail the analysis that will be 
performed to replicate the focal result. This analysis must align as closely as possible with the 
original study’s analysis, even if you have identified limitations in the original study. The level of 
detail should allow anyone to reproduce your analyses from your description below. Examples 
of what should be specified: the model; each variable; adjustments made to the standard errors 
and to case weighting; additional analyses that are required to set up the focal analysis; and the 
software used. 
 
Beyond the replication of the focal analysis from the original study, it is at your discretion to test 
the claim using other analytic approaches as a check of the robustness of the claim. The 
original test should be listed first and be clearly distinguished from any other tests. If you are 
testing additional confirmatory hypotheses, describe them in the same order as you numbered 
them in the “Hypotheses” section above and make clear reference to the specific hypothesis 
being tested for each. 
 
Please provide a link to a clearly commented script that performs the analysis described in the 
narrative provided below. Our preference is that this be either an R script or a script from 
another language that similarly allows for open and reproducible analyses. Please let the 
SCORE team know if this is not possible. Please also test that the code runs without error on a 
random subset of 5% of the replication dataset, and provide verification that the code has 
produced a sensible result below (a screenshot of the results is preferable). Finally, please 
confirm that you have only developed and tested your analysis plan and code using 5% of the 
data. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the ​Reviewer Criteria​): 
●
Does the preregistration specify which statistical model will be used to provide the ‘focal 
evidence’ for the SCORE test (e.g. a regression coefficient in a larger multiple regression 

 
model), and does it correspond closely to the model and evidence from the original 
study? 
●
Does the preregistration describe each variable that will be included in the focal analysis, 
and what role each variable has (e.g. dependent variable, independent variable)? 
●
Does the preregistration include a detailed specification of the focal analysis, including 
interactions, lagged terms, controls, etc., in both narrative form and in a clearly 
commented script? 
●
Does the preregistration verify that the code runs without error on a random subset of 
the replication dataset? 
 
This statement confirms that only 5% of the data have been randomly sampled in 
developing the analysis plan and code contained in this preregistration. 
 
Lines 19 to 66 of the Stata do-file “​Hossain 2020 - Replication Analysis 5% random sample.do​” 
generate a random sample that contains only 5% of the data. Before the sample is drawn, the 
type of data that is used in the analysis needs to be indicated through the local "dataset": 
 
1.
A dataset value equal to 1 draws the random sample from the data used in the 
original study. This is, cases of infection per one million people on April 03 2020. 
 
2.
A dataset value equal to 2 draws the random sample from the data after the 
original study was conducted. This is, cases of infection per one million people after 
April 03 2020. 
 
3.
A dataset value equal to 3 draws the random sample from the whole-time frame. 
This is, cases of infection per one million people between December 31 2019 and 
August 11 2020. 
 
4.
A dataset value equal to 4 draws the random sample from the time frames not 
used in the original study. This is, cases of infection per one million people between 
December 31 2019 and August 11 2020; and cases of infection per one million people 
after April 03 2020. 
 
5.
A dataset value equal to 5 draws the random sample from all available time 
frames. 
 
To replicate the analysis an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is estimated. The 
dependent variable indicates the total number of cases of confirmed infection per one million 
people in a country on a day. The focal independent variable is the democracy index. Moreover, 
temperature and openness are included as covariates. The software used is Stata 15.1 
 
The analysis code is “​Hossain 2020 - Replication Analysis 5% random sample.do​” A log file with 
the Stata session demonstrates that this code works: 

 
 1.​     ​File “​Hossain_5_Random_Sample_Original_Study.pdf​” shows how the analysis 
code works using a random 5% of the original study data. This is, cases of infection per 
one million people on April 03 2020. 
2.​     ​File “​Hossain_5_Random_Sample_After_Original_Study.pdf​” shows how the 
analysis code works using a random 5% of the data after the original study was 
conducted. This is, cases of infection per one million people after April 03 2020.  
3.​     ​File “​Hossain_5_Random_Sample_Whole_Time_Frame.pdf​” shows how the analysis 
code works using a random 5% of the data of the whole-time frame. This is, cases of 
infection per one million people between December 31 2019 and August 11 2020. 
4.​     ​File “​Hossain_5_Random_Sample_Not_Original_Study.pdf​” shows how the analysis 
code works using a random 5% of the time frames not used in the original study. This is, 
cases of infection per one million people between December 31 2019 and August 11 
2020; and cases of infection per one million people after April 03 2020.  
5.​     ​File “​Hossain_5_Random_Sample_All_Available_Time_Frames.pdf​” shows how the 
analysis code works using a random 5% of the all available time frames. 
20. Transformations 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​This section should describe how any of the measured variables or 
composite measures mentioned above will be transformed prior to the analyses listed in Section 
19. These are adjustments made to variables ​after​ measurement or measure creation, and 
might include centering, logging, lagging, rescaling etc. Please provide enough detail such that 
anyone else could reproduce the transformations based on the description below. Please be 
sure this preregistration includes a link to a clearly commented script that performs the 
transformations described in the narrative provided below. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the ​Reviewer Criteria​): 
●
Does the preregistration specify which of the measured variables or composite 
measures will need to be transformed prior to the focal analysis? 
●
For each variable needing transformation, does the preregistration adequately describe 
the transformations, including any centering, logging, lagging, recoding, or 
implementation of a coding scheme for categorical variables? 
●
Does the preregistration link to a clearly commented script that performs each 
transformation? 
 
The variable DEMOCRACY is divided by 10 to obtain an index with a scale from 0 to 10. The 
reason is that while The Economist publishes the index with a scale from 0 to 10, Gapminder 
(the data source for democracy index) has converted the index from 0 to 100. Because the 

 
author in the original study used the scores of democracy index compiled by the Economist 
Intelligence Unit (page 9), the data obtained in Gapminder is divided by 10. 
21. Inference criteria 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​This section describes the precise criteria that will be used to 
assess whether the hypotheses listed above were confirmed by the analyses in Section 19. The 
default language below only applies to the test of the SCORE claim, ​H*​. It is at your discretion to 
describe the inferential criteria you will use for any additional analyses. They need not rely on 
p-values and/or the same alpha level we have specified for ​H*​.  
 
If the additional analyses will use multiple comparisons, the inference criteria is a question with 
few “wrong” answers. In other words, transparency is more important than any specific method 
of controlling the false discovery rate or false error rate. One may state an intention to report all 
tests conducted or one may conduct a specific correction procedure; either strategy is 
acceptable. 
 
Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project is a statistically significant 
effect (alpha = .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal hypothesis 
test (​H*​).  
 
To test the SCORE claim, H*, that at the country level, the democracy index will be positively 
associated with the total number of confirmed infections per one million people, an Ordinary 
least squares (OLS) regression is estimated. The specification takes the form: 
 
 
ASES_PER_MILLION

22. Data exclusion 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​The section below should describe the rules you will follow to 
exclude collected cases from the analyses described in Section 19. Note that this refers to 
exclusions ​after​ the creation of the replication dataset; exclusion criteria that prevent a case 
from entering the replication dataset in the first place should be detailed in the ‘Data Collection 
Procedure’ section above. Please be as detailed as possible in describing the rules you will 
follow (e.g. What is the specific definition of outliers you will use? Exactly how many attention 
checks does a participant need to fail before their removal from the analytic sample?). 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the ​Reviewer Criteria​): 
●
Does the preregistration comment on whether any cases included in the replication 
dataset will be excluded prior to data analysis? 
●
If yes, does the preregistration provided detailed instructions on how the exclusions will 
be performed (e.g. Is the definition of outlier provided? Is the number of attention checks 
failed before a participant is excluded specified?) 
 
No observations are excluded from the analysis. 
23. Missing data 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​The section below should describe how missing or incomplete data 
will be handled. Please be as detailed as possible in describing the exact procedures you will 
follow (e.g. last value carried forward; mean imputation) and any software required (e.g. We will 
use Amelia II in R to perform the imputation). 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the ​Reviewer Criteria​): 
●
Does the preregistration comment on how missing or incomplete data will be addressed 
(e.g. casewise removal, missing data imputation)? 
●
If applicable, does the preregistration specify how many missing variables will lead to a 
case’s removal (e.g. If a subject does not complete any of the three indices of tastiness, 
that subject will not be included in the analysis.)? 
●
If applicable, does the preregistration describe how missing data imputation will be 
performed, including relevant software? 
 
The replication data do not contain any missing data. 
24. Exploratory analysis (Optional) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected 
differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test 
where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to 
use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new 
confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time. If any exploratory analyses 

 
involve additions to the data collection procedure beyond what was performed in the original 
study (e.g. additional items on the survey; running another condition in the experiment), please 
describe them below. 
 
25. Other 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:​ ​This section serves two purposes. First, please​ ​use this section to 
discuss any features of your replication plan that are not discussed elsewhere. Literature cited, 
disclosures of any related work such as replications or work that uses the same data, plans to 
make your data and materials public, or other context that will be helpful for future readers 
would be appropriate here. Second, please also re-surface any major deviations from earlier in 
the preregistration that you expect a reasonable reviewer could flag for concern. Give a 
summary of these deviations, focusing on larger changes and any possible challenges for 
comparing the results of the original and replication study. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the ​Reviewer Criteria​): 
●
Does the preregistration reference other sections of the preregistration where substantial 
deviations from the original study have been described (including deviations due to 
differences in location or time compared to the original study)?  
●
Does the preregistration comment on plans to make the data and materials from the 
replication study public? 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Final review checklist 
REVIEWER INSTRUCTIONS: ​For the following questions, reviewers please indicate whether 
you can ‘sign off’ on the following items by adding a comment. You can update this response as 
the lab moves through revisions during the review period! 
 
●
Included in this pre-registration are specific materials needed to create a replication 
dataset: 
○
Is the final replication dataset that the research team constructed suitable for 
performing a high-quality, good-faith replication of the focal claim selected from 
the original study? 
 
 
○
Is the procedure for constructing the final replication dataset sufficiently 
documented that an independent researcher could construct the same dataset 
following the procedures and code they lay out? 
 
●
Included with this pre-registration is a narrative description of how the replication dataset 
will be used to perform the focal replication analysis, as well as the specific analytic 
scripts/code/syntax that will be used: 
○
Is the analysis plan (including code) that’s documented in the preregistration 
consistent with a high-quality, good-faith replication of the focal claim selected 
from the original study? 
 
○
Has the data analyst demonstrated that the analysis code works as expected on 
a random 5% of the final replication dataset? 
 
 
●
I have reviewed all sections of this pre-registration, and I believe it represents a 
good-faith replication attempt of the original focal claim.

To interpret the replication results and fill out the structured JSON report, I need to gather information from the provided files. The key files to examine are the structured documents and logs related to the replication process. Here's the plan:

1. **Read the `post_registration.json`** to understand the key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. **Read the `replication_info.json`** to understand the planning stage for the replication.
3. **Read the `execution_results.json`** to get the final structured report of the execution stage.
4. **Read the `interpret_easy.log`** to gather any additional insights or issues encountered during the interpretation process.

Let's start by reading the `post_registration.json` file.

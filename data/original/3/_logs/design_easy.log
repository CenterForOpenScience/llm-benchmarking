To begin planning the replication study, I need to gather information from the provided documents. The first step is to understand the focal claim from the original study, which is detailed in the `initial_details.txt` file. This will help me determine the hypothesis for the replication study. 

Next, I will need to examine the `post_registration.json` file to understand the original study's methodology and data sources. This will help in assessing the replication data's suitability.

Finally, I will explore the `replication_data` folder to ensure that the necessary variables are available and that the data qualifies for replication criteria.

            "description": "This study was conducted through an online self-administered questionnaire. The survey comprised of questions about (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), (iii) coping activities , and (iv) the students’ most serious concern during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "steps": "1. Prepare the online questionnaire (close-ended questions via Google Forms; language - Arabic; constisting of three sections, with a total of 24 questions: 1a. The first section has seven sociodemographic questions: age, gender, the region of residence, study level, type of academic institution, marital status, and smoking status along with two questions about the history of pre-existing psychiatric conditions and related medication use.  1b. The second section includes an Arabic version of the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10).  1c. The third section has five questions concerning: coping activities during COVID-19 pandemic and the nationwide curfew in Jordan, the use of medications to cope with COVID-19 related distress, the students’ motivation for online distance learning, and lhe issue with the greatest concern during COVID-19 pandemic as perceived by the students. 2. Compose a Facebook/Whatsapp survey recruitment message that includes a link leading to information letter about the study, eligibility criteria (age ≥ 18 years, residing in Jordan, active enrollment in an undergraduate or postgraduate study at a Jordanian University), and informed consent as a pre-request to proceed in participation. 3. Recruit the participants through social media (Facebook and WhatsApp; in the current study the questionnaire was distributed across seven randomly chosen Facebook groups of university students in Jordan and academic groups on WhatsApp messenger for a one-day period). 4. Compute total K10 scores and categorize psychological distress.The response choices and scoring: None of the time (1 point), A little of the time (2 points), Some of the time (3 points), Most of the time (4 points), and All the of time (5 points). As per the scale’s guide, Q3 and Q6 were not asked in current study and were scored as one point if the preceding questions Q2 and Q5 were answered as None of the time. The severity of psychological distress is calculated as the total K10 distress score for each participant: 10-19 = no psychological distress, 20-24 = mild psychological distress, 25-29 = moderate psychological distress, and 30-50 = severe  psychological distress. 5. Use multinomial logistic regression to examine associations between psychological distress severity and gender and motivation for distance learning (reference category: no distress.",

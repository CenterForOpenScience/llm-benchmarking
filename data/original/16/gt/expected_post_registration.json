The authors downloaded mobility data from the Citymapper Mobility Index and unspecified data on the implementation of governmental social distancing measures from unspecified official government and media websites. \n2. Then, they classified each city as having instituted social distancing measures if non-essential businesses were closed\n3. Further classified measures as moderate or intense based on the intensity of closure.\n4.

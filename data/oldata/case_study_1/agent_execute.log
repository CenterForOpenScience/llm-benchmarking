Thought: The error persists, indicating that there might still be an issue with the Dockerfile. I will re-read the contents of the Dockerfile to ensure that the `FROM` line was correctly added and that there are no other syntax issues.

Thought: Since the command to manually edit the Dockerfile was denied, I am unable to proceed with correcting the Dockerfile. As a result, I cannot continue with the subsequent steps of building the Docker image and executing the study. I will stop the container if it was started and provide a summary of the situation.

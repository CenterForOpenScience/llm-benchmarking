To begin planning the replication study, I need to gather information from the provided documents. The first step is to understand the focal claim from the original study and the details of the replication data. I will start by examining the `initial_details.txt` file to understand the claim and then explore the `post_registration.json` for additional structured information. After that, I will inspect the `replication_data` folder to assess the datasets available for replication.

**Step 1:** Read the `initial_details.txt` to understand the focal claim.
**Step 2:** Read the `post_registration.json` for structured information about the original study.
**Step 3:** List the files in the `replication_data` folder to identify available datasets.

Let's start with Step 1.

The relationship between violence and election fraud follows an inverted U-shape: fraud increases with violence up to a certain level, then decreases.

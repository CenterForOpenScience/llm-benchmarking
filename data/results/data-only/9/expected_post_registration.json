Data was pooled across countries to create a shared two-dimensional policy space. The number of parties is measured both by a simple count of parties meeting the 1% seat threshold and by the effective number of parties based on seat shares. Party dispersion is measured as the distance between the two most extreme parties along each policy dimension (how far apart political parties are from each other in terms of their policy positions)."

Select twenty established parliamentary democracies (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom). \n2. Include parties with at least 1% of seats in parliament in two consecutive elections. \n3. Exclude parties below 1% in three consecutive elections. \n4.Compute number of parties. \n4. Define two policy dimensions (economic and social) using specific CMP categories (p. 814., note 37).\n5. Conduct principal components analysis (PCA) to estimate party positions along each dimension. \n6. Calculate party dispersion as the distance between the two most extreme parties on each dimension within each country–election. \n7. Regress dispersion on the log of number of parties, with robust standard errors clustered by country.",

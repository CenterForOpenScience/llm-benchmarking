Policy space constructed via principal components analysis on CMP categories to form economic and social dimensions. Social dimension construction is less consensual than economic. Limited within-country variation in number/type of parties led to pooling across countries."

      "description": "The study uses CMP manifesto data to estimate party positions in a two-dimensional policy space (economic and social) via principal components analysis. Party dispersion within each party system is measured as the distance between the most extreme parties along each dimension. The number of parties is measured using both a relevance count and the effective number of parties. The relationship between party dispersion and the number of parties is tested using OLS regressions with log-transformed variables, including electoral system type as a control. Analyses cover twenty parliamentary democracies from 1945 to 1999.",

      "summary": "Party dispersion increases with the number of parties but plateaus at around five parties. Once the number of parties is accounted for, electoral rules have no direct effect on dispersion. Two-party systems also exhibit non-trivial party distances, indicating parties do not fully converge to the median voter. Regression analyses with log-transformed variables show a positive, statistically significant relationship between the number of parties and dispersion in both economic and social dimensions, with modest explanatory power.",

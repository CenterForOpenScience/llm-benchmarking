  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10-slim Docker image from replication_info.json and launched a container. Upon human approval, attempted to run the Python entrypoint (run_replication.py). Execution initially failed due to a missing scikit-learn module. In accordance with the RUN POLICY, I rewrote the PCA step to a NumPy-based implementation and removed scikit-learn dependencies. The rerun completed successfully. The analysis used CMP_final.dta and CPDS_final.dta (mounted to /app/data), constructed policy dimensions via NumPy PCA (since precomputed dimensions were not found), computed dispersion by country-election, used a simple party count fallback (since seat shares were not found), merged the 'prop' control from CPDS, and ran OLS with clustered SEs by country. Results support the preregistered hypothesis: the coefficient of log(number of parties) on log(dispersion) is positive and statistically significant on both economic and social dimensions.",

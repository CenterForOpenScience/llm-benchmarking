  "interpretation_summary": "The replication implemented OLS models of log party dispersion on log number of parties (with a proportionality control) using CMP and CPDS-derived data, constructing economic and social dimensions via PCA. Execution succeeded and produced clustered-robust estimates at the country level. The focal economic-dimension coefficient is positive and statistically significant (0.558, SE=0.193, p=0.0038), consistent with the original\u2019s positive effect (\u22480.39, SE\u22480.14). The social-dimension result is also positive and significant (0.475, SE=0.137, p<0.001), aligning with the original claim. R-squared values are smaller than in the original, and ENP robustness is approximated (equal to the simple count) due to missing share data. Overall, the replication supports the hypothesis with similar direction and significance, somewhat larger magnitude, and some methodological approximations.",

Outputs and an analysis dataset were saved as preregistered.",

  "notes": "ENP\u2248count in this run (due to equal-share approximation) limits robustness comparisons across count and ENP specifications. Lower R2 suggests sensitivity to data construction choices or missing controls. Results remain directionally consistent with strong significance; future runs should prioritize accurate share data, stricter relevance coding, and reproducible PCA inputs. Consider testing the plateau at five parties explicitly with spline or quadratic terms."

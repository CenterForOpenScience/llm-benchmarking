Launched the container and executed the Python analysis entrypoint replicate_social_distancing.py per the plan. The script ran successfully, estimating a clustered OLS model with county-level controls and state fixed effects. The focal result quantifies the association between 2016 Trump vote share and changes in mobility (proxy for social distancing) during March 19\u201328, 2020. No major deviations from the plan were needed; environment adjustments were limited to quoting pip constraints in the Dockerfile.",

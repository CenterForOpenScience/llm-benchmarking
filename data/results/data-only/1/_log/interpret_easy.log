This code replicates the association between county-level Trump vote share and social distancing.

How it works:
1. Reads /app/data/transportation.csv and /app/data/county_variables.csv.
2. Computes average distance traveled per person per county-day using trip-distance bin midpoints and population engaged in mobility (pop_home + pop_not_home).
3. Calculates percent change relative to matched weekdays in February 2020 (pre-COVID baseline) for each county-day.
4. Averages this percent change for March 19-28, 2020 to create the outcome (negative values = more distancing).
5. Merges with county-level covariates and runs an OLS with state fixed effects and clustered SEs by state.
6. Reports the coefficient on trump_share and scales it by the original interquartile range (0.203) to compare to the original paper's 4.1 pp effect.

Outputs written to /app/data:
- regression_data.csv: analysis dataset used in the regression.
- replication_results.json: summary of key regression outputs and IQR-scaled effect.

To run inside Docker or a clean environment, ensure Python 3.10+, and install pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and patsy.

Abstract 
The U.S. is the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In response, 
governments have implemented measures to slow transmission through “social distancing.” 
However, the practice of social distancing may depend on prevailing socioeconomic conditions 
and beliefs. Using 15–17 million anonymized cell phone records, we find that lower per capita 
income and greater Republican orientation were associated with significantly reduced social 
distancing among U.S. counties. These associations persisted after adjusting for county-level 
sociodemographic and labor market characteristics as well as state fixed effects. These results 
may help policymakers and health professionals identify communities that are most vulnerable 
to transmis

Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- Any missing code should be written to replication_data inside the study path.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data".

Thought: I gathered the original claim and numeric benchmarks from the paper and post_registration.json, reviewed the preregistered replication plan and methods in replication_info.json, and examined the actual execution outputs from execution_results.json and the generated replication_data/replication_results.json. I also checked the container execution log to confirm any deviations or failures. The replication implemented the planned OLS with state fixed effects and clustered SEs, using a February 2020 matched-weekday baseline and reconstructed mobility measure, yielding a positive, statistically significant effect whose IQR-scaled estimate and CI overlap the original.

Results support the original claim: the IQR-scaled effect is positive and statistically significant, with magnitude slightly larger (+4.79 pp vs. +4.12 pp) and a wider 95% CI that overlaps the original interval.

2026-02-02 15:07:43,710 - replication - INFO - ***Agent output (Thought):
Thought: I reviewed the original paper and claim, the preregistered replication plan, and all available execution outputs. I verified the focal hypothesis and original numeric benchmarks from the paper and post_registration.json. I checked both execution_results.json and the generated replication_data/replication_results.json, and confirmed they align with the container execution logs. I noted minor methodological approximations (baseline selection and mobility reconstruction) and a small sample difference. The replicated effect is positive, significant, and its IQR-scaled CI overlaps the original, satisfying the preregistered comparison criteria.

Answer: {
  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed a clustered OLS with state fixed effects as preregistered, linking county-level mobility change (negative = more distancing) during March 19–28, 2020 to 2016 Trump vote share, controlling for demographics, industry shares, income, rurality, and state FE. Using a February 2020 matched-weekday baseline and reconstructed mobility from trip-distance bins, the replication found a positive, statistically significant association. The IQR-scaled estimate (+4.79 pp) is slightly larger than the original (+4.12 pp) with a wider but overlapping 95% CI. Fidelity to the plan was high; only environment fixes (quoting pip constraints) were needed. Overall, the replication supports the original claim.",

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed a clustered OLS with state fixed effects as preregistered, linking county-level mobility change (negative = more distancing) during March 19\u201328, 2020 to 2016 Trump vote share, controlling for demographics, industry shares, income, rurality, and state FE. Using a February 2020 matched-weekday baseline and reconstructed mobility from trip-distance bins, the replication found a positive, statistically significant association. The IQR-scaled estimate (+4.79 pp) is slightly larger than the original (+4.12 pp) with a wider but overlapping 95% CI. Fidelity to the plan was high; only environment fixes (quoting pip constraints) were needed. Overall, the replication supports the original claim.",

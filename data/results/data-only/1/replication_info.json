In this replication, matched weekdays are computed using February 2020 (transportation.csv coverage verified), which is a close proxy but not necessarily the exact reference week. Also, average distance traveled per person is reconstructed from trip-distance bins using midpoint approximations, whereas the original Unacast measure may use proprietary distance computation; this could introduce measurement deviation. Finally, we scale the Trump-share coefficient by the original IQR (0.203) from post_registration.json to report a comparable effect size."

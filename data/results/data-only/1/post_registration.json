The study used Unacast mobility data to compute percentage-point changes in average distance traveled (March 19\u201328, 2020 vs. a pre-COVID reference week), and related these to county per capita income and 2016 Trump vote share using OLS regressions with state fixed effects, adjusting for sociodemographic and labor-market covariates and rurality.",

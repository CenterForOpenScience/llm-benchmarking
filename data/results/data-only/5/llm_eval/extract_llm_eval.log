You are an information verifier. The task you're concerned with is extracting important information about a main claim in a research paper.
You are given TWO json objects: one extracted and one reference, your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the extraced JSON object based on the (key, value pair) presented in the reference JSON object.

=== END OF EXPLANATION OF WHAT EACH FIELD IN THE JSON MEAN ===

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The extracted information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the paper. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelated information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The extracted information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The extracted information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely. 

For fields where the reference is "not stated" or "NA", assign a score of 3 as long as the extracted information reflect similar meaning: "not available", "not stated", etc.

The sample was split into those in good health (very healthy or somewhat healthy) and those in poor health (unhealthy or somewhat unhealthy).\n5. Adding explanatory variables including years of education, time and risk preference parameters, age, age squared, per capita household expenditures, distance to nearest health center, and sex, the authors estimated separate probit models for the two subsamples (good vs. poor general health), using the binary under-diagnosis variable as the dependent variable. \n6.

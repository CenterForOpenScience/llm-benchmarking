      "notes": "Blood pressure measured three times by trained nurses; first reading dropped, average of the remaining two used. Hypertension defined as systolic >140 or diastolic >90 (WHO standard). Under-diagnosis defined as hypertensive by survey measurement but not previously diagnosed by a doctor. Time and risk preferences elicited via hypothetical lottery questions; respondents categorized into four groups (most to least patient; least to most risk averse). Per capita expenditures (PCE) used as proxy for income. Distance to nearest health center used to proxy access. Potential endogeneity of education and time preferences acknowledged. Probit models estimated and marginal effects reported; age and age squared included; multicollinearity checked (no concern reported)."

Analyses are conducted for the full sample and separately for respondents in good versus poor self-reported general health. A secondary analysis examines disease management among previously diagnosed individuals.",

      "summary": "At the aggregate level, higher education and household resources reduce the probability of under-diagnosis, while greater impatience increases it; women are substantially less likely to be under-diagnosed. However, effects differ by general health: among respondents in good health, education is not significant for detection, while impatience and distance to a health center increase under-diagnosis; among those in poor health, education significantly reduces under-diagnosis, whereas time preference and distance are not significant. For disease management (regular BP monitoring among diagnosed), education increases and impatience decreases the likelihood of good management, with stronger educational effects among those in poor health; household resources matter for those in good health. Risk preferences are generally not significant in these models.",

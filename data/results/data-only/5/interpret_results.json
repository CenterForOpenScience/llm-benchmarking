  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the preregistered plan to estimate a probit model with average marginal effects on IFLS Wave 4 adults aged 45+ who are hypertensive and in poor self-reported health, focusing on the effect of years of education on under-diagnosis. The executed code matched the planned specification (probit with controls: age, age^2, female, log PCE, distance). Minor implementation adjustments were required (categorical handling, poor health variable source, and data cleaning). The replication yielded a negative and statistically significant marginal effect of education (-0.00874, SE=0.00369, p=0.0179), closely matching the original reported effect (-0.00867, SE=0.00420, p<0.05), supporting the focal hypothesis.",

  "notes": "The education-years reconstruction and the choice of poor-health variable (kk01 vs si01) can slightly affect sample composition and magnitudes; however, direction and significance were robust. Results may be sensitive to hypertension threshold inclusivity and PCE construction; future replications could test inclusive thresholds (\u2265140/\u226590) and alternative expenditure measures. Adding time/risk preference controls as robustness checks could further align with the original specification, though the poor-health subgroup results are reported to be unaffected."

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication aimed to test whether Post-secular respondents were less likely than Traditional respondents to affirm human evolution in GSS 2006/2008/2010. The preregistered plan specified computing class-specific proportions and fitting a logistic regression with Traditional as the reference. The code implemented this plan (including optional weighted GLM), but execution failed at data import: pandas could not read the Stata v110 file and pyreadstat could not be reliably imported/used inside the container despite Dockerfile updates and in-script installation attempts. No results were produced; thus, the focal hypothesis could not be tested.",

Once data access is resolved (CSV or compatible .dta), the script should produce class-specific proportions and the focal logistic regression as planned. Consider verifying variable names for the evolution item and class membership after data conversion and re-running sensitivity checks (weighted vs unweighted)."

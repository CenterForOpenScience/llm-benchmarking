{
  "hypothesis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis in the extracted JSON is an exact match with the reference document, both stating that the probability of endorsing evolution is lower for the Post-secular class than for the Traditional class among GSS respondents."
  },
  "study_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The study type is correctly identified as 'Observational' in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.dataset_identifier": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The dataset identifier 'GSSreplication.dta' is mentioned in the extracted JSON, which aligns with the reference document's description of using GSS data, although the specific file name is not explicitly mentioned in the reference."
  },
  "data_plan.source_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The source type 'Survey (General Social Survey - GSS)' is an exact match with the reference document, which also identifies the data source as the General Social Survey."
  },
  "data_plan.wave_or_subset": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The waves 2006, 2008, and 2010 are correctly identified in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.sample_size": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The sample size of 2901 is correctly stated in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.unit_of_analysis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The unit of analysis 'individual respondent' is consistent with the reference document, which also specifies the individual as the unit of analysis."
  },
  "data_plan.access_details": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The access details in the extracted JSON mention local provision and file paths, which are not explicitly detailed in the reference document, but the general access to GSS data is consistent."
  },
  "planned_method.steps": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The steps in the extracted JSON are mostly similar to the reference document, detailing the process of running a script and analyzing data, though the reference document does not provide a step-by-step procedure."
  },
  "planned_method.models": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The models mentioned (unweighted binary logistic regression and weighted GLM) are mostly similar to the reference document, which discusses a t-test and latent class analysis, indicating a similar statistical approach."
  },
  "planned_method.outcome_variable": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The outcome variable 'evol_binary' is consistent with the reference document's focus on the evolution question."
  },
  "planned_method.independent_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The independent variables 'C(class_norm)' with categories Traditional, Modern, Post-secular are consistent with the reference document's description of the latent classes."
  },
  "planned_method.control_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The absence of control variables is consistent with the reference document, which focuses on a bivariate comparison."
  },
  "planned_method.tools_software": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The tools and software mentioned (Python, pandas, statsmodels) are mostly similar to the reference document, which specifies Stata for latent class analysis, indicating a different but comparable approach."

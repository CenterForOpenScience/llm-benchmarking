Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the "fidelity_assessment" and "results_comparisons" aspects: 
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent.

Replication of a Research Claim from O’Brien & Noy (2015),  
from American Sociological Review. 
 
Claim Summary  
The claim selected from O’Brien & Noy (2015) is that, although the post-secular perspective 
entails high levels of science knowledge as well as favorable views of science and religion, when 
scientific and religious perspectives conflict (e.g. evolution), the post-secular latent class almost 
unanimously aligned their views with particular religious accounts. This reflects the following 
statement from the paper's abstract: "Overall, most individuals favor either scientific or religious 
ways of understanding, but many scientifically inclined individuals prefer certain religious 
accounts." Participants’ responses to the General Social Survey (GSS) were submitted to a latent 
class analysis that resulted in a three-class solution characterized as representing traditional, 
modern, and post-secular perspectives on science and religion. Following this assignment, two-
tailed t-tests were used to compare responses between the three groups; for the purposes of the 
SCORE project, the focal test is the comparison between the Traditional and Post-Secular groups 
on the question concerning evolution (‘Human beings developed from earlier species of 
animals’, yes or no). Members of the post-secular category were significantly less likely than 
members of the traditional group to respond that humans evolved from other animals (3 percent, 
significant at p < 0.05 on a two-tailed test, see Table 2, rightmost column). We replicate this 
study using the GSS years not included in the original survey. All variables remain the same.  
 
Replication Criteria 
Respondents with a post-secular perspective on science and religion will have significantly 
different responses than respondents with a traditional perspective on science and religion to the 
question asking whether humans evolved from other animals. This will be shown by a two-tailed 
t-test (p<.05) with post-secularists having significantly different values to the question that 
humans evolved from other animals than the traditionalists.  
Replication Result 
To conduct this analysis, I first had to assign labels (traditional, modern, post-secularists) to the 
classes developed through the Latent Class Analysis. I assign these labels using these criteria: 
1.     The modern category will have the weakest religious beliefs and high scores for 
science literacy and attitude questions. 
2.     The traditionalist category will have strong religious beliefs and low scores for all 
science literacy and attitude questions. 
3.   The post-secular category will have strong religious beliefs and high scores for many 
science and literacy questions, but not all. 
The classes found in my analyses differ for responses to variables regarding opinions of science 
(advfront, toofast, nextgen). For these variables, modernists were not consistently the group with 
the highest values, as found in the original paper. However, the central indicators of religiosity 
and knowledge of science closely matched the results from the original paper. For this reason, 
the categories found in my analyses still reflect the classes interpreted by the original paper. 
 

All Possible Observations Years 
The replication using years 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 included 5,260 
observations, which met the stage 1 threshold of 153 observations defined by the power analysis. 
The results of a two-sample t-test comparing the mean value for responses to the question, 
“Human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals. (Is that true 
or false?)” show post-secularists (mean =.04, std. error = .01) have significantly (t-statistic = 
21.78, degrees of freedom = 3,345, p = .0000 by Stata16) different rates of correct responses, 
compared to traditionalists (mean = .35, std. error = .01). Thus, this replication of the claim was 
successful according to the SCORE criteria. The claim selected for the original study yielded a 
negative Cohen’s d in the focal test, corresponding to 75%. The replication yielded a negative 
Cohen’s d in the focal test (79%), corresponding to an effect in the same pattern compared to the 
original study. 
 
Same Years as Original Study 
The replication using years 2006, 2008, and 2010 included 2,991 observations, which met the 
stage 1 threshold of 153 observations defined by the power analysis. The results of a two-sample 
t-test comparing the mean value for responses to the question, “Human beings, as we know them 
today, developed from earlier species of animals. (Is that true or false?)” show post-secularists 
(mean =.02, std. error = .01) have significantly (t-statistic = 16.03, degrees of freedom = 1,875, p 
= .0000 by Stata16) different rates of correct responses, compared to traditionalists (mean = .32, 
std. error = .01). Thus, this replication of the claim was successful according to the SCORE 
criteria. The claim selected for the original study yielded a negative Cohen’s d in the focal test, 
corresponding to 75%. The replication yielded a negative Cohen’s d in the focal test (77%), 
corresponding to an effect in the same pattern compared to the original study. 
 
Years Following the Original Sample 
The replication using years 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 included 2,269 observations, which met 
the stage 1 threshold of 153 observations defined by the power analysis. The results of a two-
sample t-test comparing the mean value for responses to the question, “Human beings, as we 
know them today, developed from earlier species of animals. (Is that true or false?)” show post-
secularists (mean =.04, std. error = .01) have significantly (t-statistic = 16.57, degrees of freedom 
= 1,436, p = .0000 by Stata16) different rates of correct responses, compared to traditionalists 
(mean = .41, std. error = .02). Thus, this replication of the claim was successful according to the 
SCORE criteria. The claim selected for the original study yielded a negative Cohen’s d in the 
focal test, corresponding to 75%. The replication yielded a negative Cohen’s d in the focal test 
(90%), corresponding to an effect in the same pattern compared to the original study.

Deviations from the preregistration 
I thank a reviewer for recommending testing the model fit for varying numbers of latent classes 
using Bayern Information Criterion. I include this in the analysis code; however, each result 
suggests that 4 classes fit the data better than 3 classes. The original authors show similar results 
in their online supplement (found here), but decide to use 3 classes due to the results of Lo-
Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio tests. That test is currently unavailable in Stata.  
 
The inferential criteria in the preregistration suggests that the replication relies on the result of a 
one-tailed test (given the post-secularists will have significantly lower values than the 
traditionalists); however, the SCORE project team requires all results be shown as a two-tailed 
test therefore this document only provides the results of the two-tailed test. 
 
Deviations from the Original Study 
To conduct the Latent Class Analysis, the original studies uses MPlus, while this study uses the 
Lclass extension to the GSEM package in Stata 16. Otherwise, this study contains results from 
the same GSS years used in the original paper (2006, 2008, 2010), years not used by the original 
paper (2012, 2014, 2016, 2018), and a combined analysis with all eligible years from the GSS  
(2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018). The central replication point reflects the years not 
used in the original study. 
I tested the analytic sample my code produces using the same years as the original study. I found 
that my sample contains 90 more respondents than the original study. It is unclear how the 
original authors decided to remove those observations. I do not believe this difference changes 
the outcome of the focal hypothesis test.

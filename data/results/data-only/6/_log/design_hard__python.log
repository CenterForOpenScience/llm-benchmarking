[CLAIM]
Overall, most individuals favor either scientific or religious ways of understanding, but many scientifically inclined individuals prefer certain religious accounts. Members of the post-secular category were significantly less likely than members of the traditional group to respond that humans evolved from other animals (3 percent, significant at p < 0.05 on a two-tailed test).

[HYPOTHESIS]
Respondents with a post-secular perspective on science and religion will be less likely than respondents with a traditional perspective on science and religion to respond that humans evolved from other animals.

--- PDF SUMMARY (Document was 25 pages long) ---
The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

The paper "Traditional, Modern, and Post-Secular Perspectives on Science and Religion in the United States" by Timothy L. O’Brien and Shiri Noy uses data from the General Social Survey to examine how Americans perceive the relationship between science and religion. Through latent class analysis, the study identifies three main perspectives: traditional (43%), where individuals prefer religion over science; modern (36%), where science is favored over religion; and post-secular (21%), where both are viewed favorably, though post-secular individuals tend to root their views in religion when faced with conflicts such as creation versus evolution. 

The study finds that these perspectives do not necessarily align with denominational or ideological divides, signifying a more complex interplay between science and religion than traditionally understood. Regression models also show that these perspectives influence attitudes on political issues like abortion and stem cell research, further highlighting the cultural and epistemological divides rather than straightforward religious versus scientific reasoning.

The research challenges the traditional secularization theory that science would wholly replace religion in modern societies, emphasizing that many individuals balance both worldviews, with conflicts mostly limited to specific issues. The paper underscores the complexity of the interaction between science and religion in the U.S., and how these perspectives contribute to broader cultural and political conflicts.

The document discusses the complex relationship between science and religion, particularly in the context of American society, where public support for science coexists with high levels of religiosity, contrasting with secularization trends observed in Europe. It introduces the concept of a "post-secular" society, where in

Thought: I inspected the provided documents to identify the focal claim and relevant methodological details (initial_details.txt, post_registration.json, original_paper.pdf). The dataset file is a Stata file (GSSreplication.dta) that likely includes precomputed latent class assignments for respondents. I created a Python replication script in the replication_data folder that reads the data from /app/data, detects and recodes the evolution question, detects and normalizes the latent class variable (Traditional, Modern, Post-secular), computes class-specific proportions, and estimates the focal comparison using a logistic regression with Traditional as the reference. I also added a weighted analysis pathway (if a survey weight column is present) via GLM Binomial with frequency weights and weighted proportions. All outputs are saved to /app/data. Below is the complete replication plan and codebase details.

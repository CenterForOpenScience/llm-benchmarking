      "description": "The study uses General Social Survey data (2006, 2008, 2010) to identify latent perspectives on science and religion via latent class analysis, then examines sociodemographic predictors of class membership using multinomial logistic regression and assesses how these perspectives relate to political attitudes using binary and ordinal logistic regressions.",

        "Assemble GSS 2006, 2008, and 2010 data with science-attitude/knowledge items and religious questions; apply survey design considerations and handle missing data.",
        "Construct indicators of science attitudes, science knowledge (quiz-style factual items), and religiosity (e.g., beliefs about the Bible, religious attendance, views on evolution and the Big Bang).",
        "Estimate latent class analysis (LCA) models with varying numbers of classes; compare fit using BIC and LMR likelihood-ratio tests and select the three-class solution based on LMR and theoretical considerations.",
        "Classify respondents into Traditional, Modern, and Post-secular classes based on posterior probabilities.",
        "Estimate multinomial logistic regression models predicting latent class membership from sociodemographic variables (e.g., race, education, income, religious affiliation, political ideology).",
        "Estimate binary and ordinal logistic regression models of political attitudes (e.g., abortion rights, stem cell research funding, GM food, fuel economy, nuclear power) using latent class membership as key predictors and controlling for denominational affiliation, ideology, religious service attendance, and other sociodemographics.",

    "results": {
      "summary": "Latent class analysis identified three perspectives: Traditional (43%), Modern (36%), and Post-secular (21%). Traditional individuals exhibit lower science literacy and stronger preference for religious explanations; Modern individuals are most knowledgeable about science and least religious; Post-seculars combine high science knowledge with strong religious commitment and side with religion when conflicts arise. These perspectives are not reducible to denomination or ideology and significantly shape political attitudes on issues mobilized by both scientific and religious authorities. Post-seculars and Traditionals are more opposed to abortion rights and stem cell research funding than Moderns (p < .05), with a marginal gap for GM foods (p < .10). No significant religio-scientific divides were found for fuel economy and nuclear energy.",

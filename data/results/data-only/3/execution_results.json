  "execution_summary": "We built a Python 3.10 Docker environment and executed a Python rewrite of the replication. The initial run failed with a syntax error in replicate_democracy_covid.py due to a duplicated function definition, which was fixed. The script read the provided dataset (RDS/DTA), standardized variable names, inferred key variables, and ran OLS with HC1 standard errors. Precipitation and population density were not found in the dataset and were omitted with a warning. The baseline/refined models regressed cases per million on temperature, trade openness, and democracy index. Execution completed successfully, and outputs were saved to app/data. This aligns with the preregistered focal hypothesis testing the positive relationship between democracy and infections per million.",

Total cases of infection were converted to cases per one million population to capture the population effect. The economic and social variables, viz. openness, democracy index and population density were measured on yearly basis. The explanatory variables are static in nature.The estimated models suffer from heteroscedasticity and violate the normality assumption. Also, the model of interest (Model 1) is not free from autocorrelation."

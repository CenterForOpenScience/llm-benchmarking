Replication of a Research Claim from Hossain (2020), from medRxiv 
Claim Summary 
The claim selected for replication from Hossain (2020) is that a cohesive society where people 
are involved in more festivals and religious gatherings is more likely to have more cases of 
COVID-19. This reflects the following statements from the paper's abstract: “The estimation 
results indicate that the number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus infection is higher in countries 
with lower yearly average temperature, higher economic openness, and stronger political 
democracy.” The description of the analysis is as follows: “By estimating a regression equation 
where the dependent variable is the total number of cases confirmed infection per one million 
people in a country on a day (03 April 2020) and the predictor variables are the democracy index 
of the country (the proxy variable for social cohesiveness), the yearly average temperature of the 
country, and the openness of the country (measured by international trade as a percentage of 
GDP)...We apply Least Squares method on model (1) and find that precipitation and population 
density have no significant effect on the number of infection cases per one million people (Y). 
Those variables are then excluded, and the model is re-estimated. In the re-estimated model, the 
variables average temperature, openness and democracy appear as highly significant.” The focal 
finding is: “The positive sign of democracy index indicates that more democratic countries are 
affected more by the disease.” 
Focal hypothesis H*: At the country level, the democracy index will be positively associated 
with the total number of confirmed infections per one million people. 
Replication Criteria 
Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project is a statistically significant 
effect (alpha = .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal hypothesis test 
(H*). 
Replication Results 
1. Using data from the original study 
Table R.1 contains the results of the Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression using the data from 
the original study. This is, cases of infection per one million people on April 3, 2020. The 

3 
 
coefficient for democracy is equal to 78.96, suggesting a positive association between the 
democracy index and the total number of confirmed infections per one million people. The 
coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.000). Thus, this replication of the 
claim was successful according to the SCORE criteria. The analytic sample included 150 
countries, which did meet the minimum threshold of 38 countries defined by the power analysis. 
The Cohen’s f2 corresponds to 0.56.

2. Using data after the original study was conducted 
Table R.2 contains the results of the Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression using data after the 
original study was conducted. This is, cases of infection per one million people after April 3, 2020. 
The coefficient for democracy is equal to 46.35, suggesting a positive association between the 

4 
 
democracy index and the total number of confirmed infections per one million people. 
However, the coefficient is not statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.826). Thus, this 
replication of the claim was not successful according to the SCORE criteria. The analytic 
sample included 150 countries, which did meet the minimum threshold of 38 countries defined by 
the power analysis. The Cohen’s f2 corresponds to 0.01.

3. Using the whole-time frame 
Table R.3 contains the results of the Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression using the whole-time 
frame. This is, cases of infection per one million people between December 31, 2019 and August 
11, 2020. The coefficient for democracy is equal to 125.31, suggesting a positive association 
between the democracy index and the total number of confirmed infections per one million 
people. However, the coefficient is not statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.558).

Thus, this replication of the claim was not successful according to the SCORE criteria. The 
analytic sample included 150 countries, which did meet the minimum threshold of 38 countries 
defined by the power analysis. The Cohen’s f2 corresponds to 0.03.

4. Using time frames different to the ones in the original study 
Table R.4 contains the results of the Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression using time frames 
different from the original study. This is, cases of infection per one million people between 
December 31, 2019 and August 11, 2020; and cases of infection per one million people after April 
3, 2020. The coefficient for democracy is equal to 85.83, suggesting a positive association 
between the democracy index and the total number of confirmed infections per one million 
people. However, the coefficient is not statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.565). 
Thus, this replication of the claim was not successful according to the SCORE criteria. The 

6 
 
analytic sample included 150 countries, which did meet the minimum threshold of 38 countries 
defined by the power analysis. Note that although the same 150 countries are used, they have 
duplicate observations in the analysis, leading to a total number of 300 country-date observations.

between the democracy index and the total number of confirmed infections per one million 
people. However, the coefficient is not statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.426). 
Thus, this replication of the claim was not successful according to the SCORE criteria. The 

7 
 
analytic sample included 150 countries, which did meet the minimum threshold of 38 countries 
defined by the power analysis. Note that although the same 150 countries are used, they have

Deviations from the Original Study  
1. The unit of analysis of the original study are 163 countries. It is not clear which countries 
were specifically included in the original analysis. Countries with any missing value for 
COVID cases, population, temperature, openness, or democracy index, are deleted from 
the replication dataset. After listwise deletion, the replication dataset includes 150 
countries. This difference of 13 countries compared to the original study can potentially be 
explained by the use of a different data source for the variable “Temperature” (World bank 
instead of Wikipedia), and the years used for the imputation of the “Openness” variable. 
 
Deviations from the Preregistration  
There were no deviations from the preregistration.

  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The interpretation summary provides a detailed narrative of the replication process, including the hypothesis, methods, and results. However, it mentions a democracy coefficient of ~8.81, which is not consistent with the reference document's coefficient of 78.96. The summary also notes a smaller sample size of 150, which matches the reference. Overall, the core meaning is preserved, but there are discrepancies in the reported coefficients."

    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The execution status is reported as 'Success,' which aligns with the reference document indicating that the replication was successful according to the SCORE criteria with a statistically significant effect."

  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The method alignment is mostly similar to the reference. It describes the use of OLS regression with specified variables and robust SE, which aligns with the reference. However, it mentions the omission of precipitation and population density, which were also excluded in the original study. The description is mostly similar but lacks some specific details from the reference."

    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The issue description about using robust SE instead of conventional OLS SE is loosely related to the reference. The reference does not specify the type of SE used, so this deviation is not directly supported by the reference."

  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 1,

  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].impact": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The impact assessment of the reduced sample size as 'Moderate' aligns with the reference, which notes the sample size difference but maintains the significance of the democracy effect."

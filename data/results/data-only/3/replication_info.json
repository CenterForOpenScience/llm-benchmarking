        "explanation": "This dataset is directly qualified for replication because it is a compiled cross-country snapshot drawing on the same sources and time point as the original study. It includes the necessary variables (COVID-19 cases as of 2020-04-03, population, annual temperature, trade openness proxies, and the EIU Democracy Index) to operationalize the original regression model.",
        "similarity_to_original": "The original paper uses: ECDC cases, population (2018), yearly average temperature and precipitation, trade openness from World Bank, and Democracy Index from EIU, analyzing a cross-country snapshot on 2020-04-03 (original_paper.pdf summary; post_registration.json data section). The provided dataset includes: COVID_12_31_04_03 (confirmed cases as of 2020-04-03), popData2019 (population), Annual_temp, trade_recent/imputed_trade/trade_2016 (openness measures), and 'Democracy index (EIU)' (replication_data/COVID replication.dta; observed via file header and column names). This matches the sources and variables specified in post_registration.json and the original_paper.pdf summary.",
        "deviation_from_original": "This is a direct replication using the same cross-section and sources (post_registration.json: sample size 163; replication_data file columns indicate the same constructs). The key deviations are analytical: (1) the replication uses robust (HC1) standard errors for OLS to handle heteroscedasticity (original_paper.pdf notes heteroscedasticity); (2) precipitation and population density are included only if present in the dataset; (3) for openness, the script prioritizes 'trade_recent', then 'imputed_trade', then 'trade_2016' based on availability; (4) extended lagged dependent variable models are not implemented unless clearly identifiable lag variables exist (original_paper.pdf describes lagged models, but the provided dataset appears to be a snapshot; no clear time-series panel is present)."
      },
      "notes": "The dataset file name contains a space ('COVID replication.dta'); the script handles this by searching multiple canonical names in /app/data. Columns include spaces and punctuation (e.g., 'Democracy index (EIU)', 'COVID_12_31_04_03'); the script standardizes column names to snake_case. If a per-million cases variable is not present, the script constructs it as cases per million using COVID_12_31_04_03 and popData2019. If precipitation or population density variables are missing, the model runs without them. The openness measure is chosen among trade_recent, imputed_trade, and trade_2016 depending on availability."

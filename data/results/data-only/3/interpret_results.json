  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed a preregistered plan to test whether the Democracy Index (EIU) is positively associated with COVID-19 cases per million (as of 2020-04-03). The executed code ran OLS with HC1 robust SE using temperature, trade openness, and democracy as predictors, omitting precipitation and population density due to unavailability. Outputs show a positive and statistically significant democracy coefficient, matching the preregistered success criteria. Compared to the original paper\u2019s much larger democracy coefficient (~86.76), the replication coefficient is positive but substantially smaller (~8.81). R-squared is moderate (~0.35). Overall, execution completed successfully after an initial syntax error fix, and the focal hypothesis was supported in sign and significance, though magnitude is attenuated and sample size is smaller (150 vs 163).",

  ],
  "notes": "The magnitude discrepancy (86.8 vs 8.81) may reflect differences in scaling (e.g., democracy index scale, dependent variable construction) and sample composition; clarifying units and transformations is recommended. Residual diagnostics indicate strong non-normality/skewness; robust SE mitigate heteroscedasticity but do not address potential model misspecification. Results are from an early-pandemic cross-sectional snapshot and may be sensitive to data vintage and missingness; sensitivity analyses (e.g., alternative openness proxies, excluding outliers, reweighting) are advisable."

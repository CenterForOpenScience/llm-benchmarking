      "description": "The study uses cross-country regression analysis to examine how environmental (temperature, precipitation), economic (openness to trade), and social-political (democracy) factors relate to COVID-19 infection rates per million. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models are estimated, including versions with lagged infection values to account for autoregressive dynamics. Multicollinearity is addressed by residualizing lagged infection values against other explanatory variables.",

      "summary": "Temperature, economic openness, and democracy are significantly associated with COVID-19 cases per million: higher openness and higher democracy correlate with more cases, while higher temperature correlates with fewer cases. Precipitation and population density are not significant and were excluded. Models showed good fit (especially at lower lags), some heteroscedasticity and non-normality, and little autocorrelation.",

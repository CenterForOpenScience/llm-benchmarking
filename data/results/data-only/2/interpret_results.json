  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the preregistered plan on PISA 2012: detecting SCMAT (math self-concept), MEMOR (memorization), and PV1\u2013PV5 math plausible values; constructing standardized variables; computing school-average math ability; and fitting three-level MixedLMs with random intercepts for schools and country variance components. Despite MixedLM convergence warnings, all five per-PV fits completed and a Rubin-combined estimate was produced. Compared to the original 2003 PISA finding of a negative interaction between memorization and school-average ability (coef \u2248 -0.089; effect size -0.157; p < .001), the replication yielded a small positive and highly significant interaction (\u2248 +0.0118; p \u2248 2.8e-10). Thus, on a later PISA wave the direction reverses, failing the preregistered directional criterion. Overall, methods aligned well with the plan, but the absence of sampling/replicate weights and convergence warnings warrant caution.",

  "notes": "Wave differences (2003 vs 2012), measurement nuances, and lack of weighting could contribute to discrepancies. The sign reversal suggests the moderator effect may not generalize across PISA waves or is sensitive to analytic choices. Recommend re-running with PISA weights/replicate weights, testing alternative random-effects structures, and conducting sensitivity analyses (e.g., country-by-country, weighting vs unweighted, alternative scaling, and specification checks). Results here are precise but accompanied by convergence warnings; interpret with caution."

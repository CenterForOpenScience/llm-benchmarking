{
  "hypothesis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis in the extracted JSON matches the hypothesis described in the reference document. Both describe the interaction between school-average mathematics ability and memorization in predicting mathematics self-concept, controlling for individual mathematics ability."
  },
  "study_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The study type is correctly identified as 'Observational' in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.source_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The source type 'OECD PISA student/school survey' is consistent with the reference document, which also identifies PISA as the data source."
  },
  "data_plan.wave_or_subset": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The wave or subset 'PISA 2012 mathematics domain' is correctly identified in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.sample_size": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON states that the sample size is computed at runtime, which is mostly similar to the reference document that provides specific numbers after exclusions."
  },
  "data_plan.unit_of_analysis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The unit of analysis 'Individual student, nested within schools and countries' is consistent with the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.access_details": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The access details about the RDS file location are consistent with the reference document's description of data access."
  },
  "planned_method.steps": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The procedural steps in the extracted JSON match the detailed steps described in the reference document for conducting the analysis."
  },
  "planned_method.models": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The model 'Three-level mixed-effects linear regression' is consistent with the reference document's description of the statistical approach."
  },
  "planned_method.outcome_variable": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The outcome variable 'Mathematics self-concept' is correctly identified in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "planned_method.independent_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The independent variables 'School-average mathematics ability and memorization strategy' are consistent with the reference document."
  },
  "planned_method.control_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The control variables 'Individual mathematics ability (standardized linear and quadratic)' are consistent with the reference document."
  },
  "planned_method.tools_software": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The tools and software listed, including Python and specific packages, match the reference document."

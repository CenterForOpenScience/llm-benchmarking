Replication of a research claim from Seaton et al. (2010), from the Journal of 
Environmental Psychology 
 
Claim Summary 
The claim selected for replication from Seaton et al. (2010) is that larger BFLPE 
(big-fish-little-pond) effects were associated with students who used memorization to a greater 
extent. The original study utilizes the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 
by the OECD from 2003, which had a focus on students’ mathematical abilities. Participants 
were 15-year-old students from 41 countries (N = 276,165). PISA assesses students’ 
mathematics, literacy, and science, but PISA also contains a vast amount of additional 
information about students' families, home backgrounds, and SES. 
 
Students in high-ability schools who used the memorization technique to a greater extent 
suffered a larger decline in mathematics self-concept than those who used the technique to a 
lesser extent. Although all students who used memorization had lower mathematics 
self-concepts if they attended high-ability schools than students of similar memorization usage 
who attended average- or low-ability schools, the drop in mathematics self-concept was more 
pronounced for students who used memorization to a greater extent. This reflects the following 
statement from the paper's abstract: "Statistically significant moderating effects emerged in both 
areas; however, in relation to the large sample (N = 265,180), many were considered small." 
The claim was tested by regressing mathematical self-concept on the following predictor 
variables: individual mathematics ability (linear and quadratic), school-average mathematics 
ability, the moderator of interest - use of memorization studying, and the interaction of school-
average mathematics ability with memorization. Due to the large number of tests of statistical 
significance being conducted, the significance level was set at p < .001. Effect size for the 
group-level construct of BFLPE was calculated using the equation shown on p. 406; effect sizes 
that approached 0.10 or greater were considered of interest. Use of memorization moderated the 
effect of school-average ability on mathematical self-concept (-.089, p < 0.001; see Table 3), 
with an effect size of -0.1 57 (see Table 4).

We followed analytic procedures described in the original study to conduct a multilevel analysis 
using a newer PISA wave, namely PISA 2012.  
 
Deviations from the Original Study  
With regard to data collection, the only deviation, to the best of our knowledge, there is only 
difference between the original and replication studies. Specifically two constructs, 
(Cooperative Orientation and Competitive Orientation) were officially deleted from the PISA 
student questionnaire after 2003 and, thus, did not appear in the PISA 2012 data collection 
effort.  Therefore, a replication attempt would need to be followed through without these two 
constructs. This could have implications on the replication attempt, as these independent 
variables were significant, however, their standardized effect sizes are considered very small (< 
0.1 ). Furthermore, given the fact that these constructs were deleted due to potential invalidity, 
the results from the original study concerning these independent variables might also be not 
totally understood/valid. Consequently, it is expected that the non-availability of these 
independent variables for the replication attempt is minor due to potential invalid previous 
results. 
 
Deviations from the Preregistration 
Two deviations must be reported. First, we describe an error in the analytic script used to 
reanalyze the focal claim and the steps taken to produce a better replication attempt. Second, we 
describe how the ordering in which missing data were removed was revised to better match 
what was described in the original article. 
 
Error in analytic script. On page 405 of the original article (Seaton et al., 2010), the original 
authors specified the fixed components of each multilevel regression model. Specifically, they 
wrote that  
 
“… the fixed components were individual ability (both linear and quadratic), the specific 
moderator, school-average ability, and the cross-product of the moderator and school-
average ability. All models tested had a three-level structure: Individual students were at 
Level 1, schools were at Level 2, and country was at Level 3.”  

4 
 
The Data Analyst followed these and other procedures outlined in the Methods section of the 
original article to produce the multilevel regression models needed to replicate the focal analysis. 
Unfortunately, the original authors did not specify the random components of each multilevel 
model and, to the best of our knowledge, the Methods section of the original article indicates that 
random effects for school and country only needed to be specified. However, an examination of 
Table 3 (see p. 411) indicates that the random effects components included Level 3 (country 
intercept, linear ability, quadratic ability, school-average ability, and moderator), Level 2 (school 
intercept, linear ability, quadratic ability, and moderator), and Level 1 (individual intercept) 
variables. Thus, the original models (i.e., the ones used to produce the original replication result) 
were not specified correctly – some of the random effects were not included. This discrepancy 
was brought to the SCORE team’s attention on Tuesday, October 27, 2020. On Wednesday, 
November 18, 2020, the Data Analyst was given permission by the SCORE team to revise the 
analytic script to include the missing random effects and update the replication analysis result. 
Both the SCORE team and the Data Analyst agree that the revised analytic script offers a better 
test of the focal analysis claim and, thus, should be used as evidence for the SCORE project, 
rather than the preregistered analysis. 
 
Taken together, the Data Analyst revised the analytic script multilevel regression models to 
match the output (i.e., fixed and random effects) reported in Table 3 of the original article (see 
https://osf.io/qrcpe/?view_only=f8c113e4a21b45bca06c091a5db3a411). However, it is not clear 
why a Level 1 variable (i.e., the individual student) was included in the random effects 
component of the model because there is only one observation per individual in the dataset. It 
would make sense to include a random effect for the individual if multiple observations were 
recorded for each student, but an examination of the replication dataset indicates that only one 
observation per student was recorded. As such, we are not sure how a random effect can be 
captured for the individual intercept when there is only one observation per “unit” at Level 1. 
Thus, the analytic script was revised to include all random effects reported in Table 3 of the 
original article (except for the random effect at Level 1 because is only one observation per 
student). 
 
 

5 
 
Missing data. In the original analytic script, observations were removed in the following order. 
 
(1) Observations nested in schools with 10 or fewer students were removed 
(2) Observations with missing data in the focal variables were removed (i.e., math self-
concept [DV], plausible values 1-5 [IVs], and memorization [moderator] 
 
However, a closer inspection of the Methods section indicates that the ordering in which 
observations are removed should have been reversed (see page 403 of the original article; 
https://osf.io/qrcpe/?view_only=f8c113e4a21b45bca06c091a5db3a411). As such, in the revised 
analytic script, observations are removed in the following order: 
 
(1) Observations with missing data in the focal variables were removed (i.e., math self-
concept [DV], plausible values 1-5 [IVs], and memorization [moderator] 
(2) Observations nested in schools with 10 or fewer students were removed 
 
Replication Criteria 
A successful replication attempt is observed if the replication analysis produces a statistically 
significant effect (alpha = .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study for the focal 
hypothesis test (H*). The hypothesis to be tested is: The interaction of the use of memorization 
and school-average ability will be negative in its association with mathematical self-concept. As 
such, the inference criteria that will be used to assess whether or not the focal claim replicates 
will be (1 ) the direction of the final parameter estimate (needs to be negative) and (2) the 
magnitude of the final p-value (needs to be less than less than .001 [see page 405 of Seaton et al., 
201 0]. Both conditions need to be met in order for the focal claim to replicate. 
 
Replication Result 
First, we describe the original replication result, which was produced on September 14, 2020 and 
before the Data Analyst noticed an error in the analytic script used to replicate the focal claim 
result (see earlier description). Following the description of the original replication result, a 
description of the replication result that was produced using a revised analytic script is provided.

Description of original replication result. The replication included 150,331 participants nested 
within 16,007 and 65 schools and countries, respectively in the analytic sample to reach the 
requirements for Stage 1 data collection. The primary unit of analysis is the school. An estimate 
of the minimum viable sample size for the data analytic replication is 972. Furthermore, the 
Stage 1 and Stage 2 required sample sizes would be 4,711 and 10,619, respectively. As such, the 
replication study’s sample size is large enough to achieve the desired level of statistical power. 
Our multilevel modeling analysis revealed that the observed coefficient for the focal moderating 
effect was 0.001370106 (SE = 0.003331732) with a corresponding p-value of .84. Thus, this 
replication of the claim was not successful according to the SCORE criteria. 
 
Description of revised replication result. The replication included 68,088 students nested in 
5,298 and 59 countries respectively. to reach the requirements for Stage 1 data collection. The 
primary unit of analysis is the school. An estimate of the minimum viable sample size for the 
data analytic replication is 972. Furthermore, the Stage 1 and Stage 2 required sample sizes 
would be 4,711 and 10,619, respectively. As such, the replication study’s sample size is large 
enough to achieve the desired level of statistical power. Our multilevel modeling analysis 
revealed that the observed coefficient for the focal moderating effect was -0.02609457 (SE = 
0.008943238) with a corresponding p-value of 3.641247e-10. Thus, this replication of the claim 
was successful according to the SCORE criteria – the replication produced a statistically 
significant result (p < .001) that corresponded to an effect in the same pattern compared to the 
original study. In other words, the replication result supports the notion that students in high-
ability schools who used the memorization technique to a greater extent suffered a larger decline 
in mathematics self-concept than those who used the technique to a lesser extent.

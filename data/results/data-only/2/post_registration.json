      "description": "The study used multilevel modeling on the OECD PISA 2003 dataset to test the Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect (BFLPE) on mathematics self-concept and examine moderation by socioeconomic status and academic self-regulation constructs. Analyses incorporated student-level ability (linear and quadratic), school-average ability, and interactions with a set of 16 moderators. Five plausible values for mathematics ability were used in separate models and results were averaged. Effect sizes were computed to gauge practical significance.",

Individual ability positively predicted self-concept (linear and quadratic terms). Many moderators showed statistically significant interactions with school-average ability, but most were small in substantive terms. Memorization strategy and anxiety exacerbated the negative BFLPE, while positive student interactions and student-teacher relations modestly mitigated it. SES showed weak positive associations with self-concept and minimal moderation, supporting the generalizability of the BFLPE across SES levels. Overall, moderation effects were generally small, and the BFLPE was consistent across diverse student characteristics.",

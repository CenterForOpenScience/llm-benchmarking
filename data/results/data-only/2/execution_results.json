  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10 Docker image with pyreadr, pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, and patsy. Launched the container and executed the Python replication entrypoint to analyze PISA 2012 data. The script loaded the RDS, detected required columns (CNT, SCHOOLID, SCMAT, MEMOR, PV1MATH\u2013PV5MATH), constructed standardized variables, and fit three-level MixedLMs per plausible value with school and country random effects. Despite convergence warnings, models executed and produced coefficients for the focal interaction (z(school mean math ability) \u00d7 z(memorization)). Rubin's rules combined estimate was positive (~0.0118) and statistically significant (p \u2248 2.8e-10), contrary to the preregistered expectation of a negative interaction. Outputs were saved to replication_results.json and logs to replication_run_log.txt.",

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the "fidelity_assessment" and "results_comparisons" aspects: 
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

Replication of a Research Claim from Cohen et al. (2015), from American Economic 
Review 
Claim Summary 
The claim selected for replication from Cohen et al. (2015) is that all three subsidy levels lead to 
a large and significant increase in ACT (artemisinin combination therapies) access. This reflects 
the following statement from the paper’s abstract: “We show that a very high subsidy (such as 
the one under consideration by the international community) dramatically increases access, but 
nearly one-half of subsidized pills go to patients with-out malaria.” The authors study impacts on 
ACT access (as well as other measures of treatment-seeking behavior) by presenting results from 
regression equation (2). The dependent variable is “Took ACT”. The focal independent variable 
is “Any ACT subsidy”. Panel A of Table 2 presents a specification where all three ACT subsidies 
are pooled and compare outcomes to the control group. Column 1 of Table 2 reports results on 
overall ACT access.  
Focal hypothesis H*: ACT [artemisinin combination therapies] subsidies induce take-up of 
ACT. 
Replication Criteria 
Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project is a statistically significant 
effect (alpha = .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal hypothesis test 
(H*). 
Replication Result 
Table R.1 contains the results of the Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Column (1) of Table 
R.1 shows that an ACT voucher subsidy increases the likelihood that an illness is treated with ACT 
by 52.6 percentage points. The coefficient for an ACT_SUBSIDY is 0.526 with robust standard 
errors clustered at the household level of 0.044, significant at the 5% level (p = 0.000). Thus, 
this replication of the claim was successful according to the SCORE criteria. The analytic 
sample included 493 households, which did meet the minimum threshold of 94 households defined 
by the power analysis.

Deviations from the Original Study  
1. Although both studies conducted a randomized control trial in Kenya, the study districts 
and the study period are different. The data for the replication was collected six years after 
the data was collected in the original study. 

5 
 
2. A deviation of the replication data from the original study is that the intervention is a 
combination of a free diagnostic test and an ACT voucher conditional on testing positive. 
The focal analysis is the effect of any ACT subsidy on ACT take-up, regardless of whether 
the illness is malaria, and regardless of whether it was tested. The replication data cannot 
separate the effect of the ACT subsidy from the free and positive rapid diagnostic test 
(RDT). 
3. Following Cohen et al (2015, pages 622-624), the control variables are selected based on 
characteristics that do not balance across the treatment and the control group. The idea is 
to avoid any confounding in the estimates due to a lack of balance across groups. 
Consequently, the control variables are different between the original and the replication 
study. 
  
Deviations from the Preregistration  
There were no deviations from the preregistration.

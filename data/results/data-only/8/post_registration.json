      "summary": "ACT subsidies substantially increased access to ACTs, primarily via drug shops, without reducing malaria testing. Targeting was weak at very high subsidies (92%), with many ACTs going to malaria-negative individuals, particularly adults. Lowering subsidies (to 80\u201388%) improved targeting while maintaining access for children. RDT subsidies roughly doubled testing but did not meaningfully reduce ACT overuse in the short run due to partial compliance with negative results. Behavioral responses indicate within-household selection and dose/age-driven price sensitivity, with adults reducing ACT purchases more at lower subsidy levels. Simulations suggest an 80% ACT subsidy can reduce under-treatment and improve welfare relative to no subsidy or very high subsidies, while short-term cost-effectiveness of adding RDT subsidies is limited.",

  "notes": "The stark discrepancy (negative, non-significant estimates with treated group mean below control) likely reflects incorrect treatment coding and sample construction rather than a true failure to replicate. Prioritize aligning the estimand: isolate ACT-only subsidy arms, exclude RDT-subsidy households for the focal test, and restrict to first illness episode. Once group definitions and sample match the original, re-estimate the LPM with cluster-robust SEs and FE as needed. Sensitivity analyses across subsidy levels (80%, 88%, 92%) can further validate consistency with the original."

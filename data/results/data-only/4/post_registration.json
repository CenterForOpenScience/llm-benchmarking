Instruments drew on the psychometric paradigm (Slovic) and the Ways of Coping framework (Folkman & Lazarus; German version).

Coping was predominantly problem-focused, with high adherence to expert advice and careful behavior. Many engaged in protective behaviors (hand hygiene, avoiding public places/transport). Trust was highest in medical institutions and experts, followed by companies and politics. About half had food supplies for 10\u201311 days, and 41.9% reported buying more food than usual, motivated by reduced shopping frequency and quarantine preparedness.",

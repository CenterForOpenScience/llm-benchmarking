Abstract 
This paper presents preliminary results of a representative survey of the German population focusing on 
perceptions of risk and way s of coping with C OVID-19. Results show that older people estimate the risk 
of COVID-19 as being less than younger people. Women are more concerned about COVID-19 than men. 
People especially worry about being infected in places with high public traffic such as public transport and 
shops or restaurants.  
Coping strategies are highly problem -focused and most respondents listen to experts’  advice and try to 
behave calmly and appropriately. People accept that  measures to tackle COVID-19 will take time to be 
effective. Bulk buying and s toring of food is mainly justified by a combination of convenience and a 
perceived need to be prepared for potential quarantine.  
1. Research question  
With regard to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, this study aims to understand how the German population are 
perceiving and coping with the situation. The main research questions are:  
1. How do people in Germany perceive the risk of being infected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS-
CoV-2)?  
2. How do people cope with the risk of being infected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS -CoV-2) 
and the pandemic as such?  
3. Are people changing their behavior with regard to the coronavirus disease – for example, are they 
storing food? 
The survey therefore comprises three main section

Thought: I inspected the available documentation and data to design a feasible replication aligned with the original study’s claims and constraints. The dataset provided (data_gerhold.csv) contains Germany-only observations with gender, two anxiety items, and weights. The original paper reports gender differences in worry/fear and in coping scales; given our dataset’s limited scope (two anxiety items), I designed a Python replication script to test a closely aligned hypothesis: women report higher anxiety (proxy for fear/worry) than men. I created and saved a Python entrypoint script in replication_data that reads from and writes to /app/data, performs Welch t-tests and weighted WLS with robust SEs, and outputs a JSON of results. Below is the completed replication plan JSON including codebase and docker specs.

The provided dataset contains only two anxiety items (mh_anxiety_1, mh_anxiety_3) and lacks the full coping battery, so we cannot reconstruct the exact coping scales or their reliability. The sample size (10,192 rows; 10,071 usable for binary gender) differs substantially from the original N=1242 (post_registration.json; original_paper.pdf), and the presence and magnitude of weights (weight_new) suggest a different weighting scheme; therefore, we normalize weights for analysis."

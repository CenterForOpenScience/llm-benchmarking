Abstract 
This paper presents preliminary results of a representative survey of the German population focusing on 
perceptions of risk and way s of coping with C OVID-19. Results show that older people estimate the risk 
of COVID-19 as being less than younger people. Women are more concerned about COVID-19 than men. 
People especially worry about being infected in places with high public traffic such as public transport and 
shops or restaurants.  
Coping strategies are highly problem -focused and most respondents listen to experts’  advice and try to 
behave calmly and appropriately. People accept that  measures to tackle COVID-19 will take time to be 
effective. Bulk buying and s toring of food is mainly justified by a combination of convenience and a 
perceived need to be prepared for potential quarantine.  
1. Research question  
With regard to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, this study aims to understand how the German population are 
perceiving and coping with the situation. The main research questions are:  
1. How do people in Germany perceive the risk of being infected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS-
CoV-2)?  
2. How do people cope with the risk of being infected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS -CoV-2) 
and the pandemic as such?  
3. Are people changing their behavior with regard to the coronavirus disease – for example, are they 
storing food? 
The survey therefore comprises three main section s as well as an investigation of the sociodemographic 
aspects of people’s responses to the crisis:  
a. Risk perception and fear  
b. Coping 
c. Emergency food preparedness 
 
a) Risk perception  
This section addresses two aspects of risk perception. Firstly, participants were asked about their perception 
of COVID-19 with regard to a cognitive and an affective dimension. While the first aspect asks respondents 
to give a personal rating of the likelihood of being affected by COVID-19, the second focuses on fear and 
general concerns. Second ly, based on the psychometric paradigm (Slovic 1987 , Slovic, Fischhoff & 
Lichtenstein 2000) questions were asked that focus on the qualitative dimensions of the perception of 
COVID-19 such as perceived voluntariness, controllability, severity, and personal impact. 
   
2 
 
In detail, the questionnaire includes three questions asking respondents to rate the perceived likelihood of 
becoming infected by COVID-19 in future, seven questions designed to elicit information  about the ir 
personal feelings of fear and insecurity, and 30 questions addressing several qualitative dimensions that can 
help to describe COVID-19 from a subjective point of view. 
b) Coping 
This section is theoretically based on the revised , German-language version of the Ways of Coping Scale 
(Folkman & Lazarus 1988, Ferring & Filipp 1989) , drawing attention to the question of how people cope 
with COVID-19 from a psychological perspective. The German version differs especially in its distinction 
between problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies. In addition, concrete behaviors are part 
of the survey,1 with particular focus on tangible instances of behavior like washing and disinfecting hands.  
In the questionnaire, 28 questions with regard to problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies for 
coping with the COVID- 19 crisis are included as well as seven items concerning concrete behavior.  
Additionally four questions are focusing on trust in politics, authorities from the medical field and 
companies. 
c) Emergency food preparedness 
Several political and administrative strategies for dealing with COVID-19 in Germany focus on asking that 
people stay at home. As a consequence more and more people in Germany have started to buy greater 
quantities of certain foodstuffs. Although public authorities have repeatedly stressed that food supply chains 
are robust, people are continuing to hoard as the situation develops.  
In the questionnaire, ten questions ask, for instance, about the number of days for which people have been 
storing food and their reasons for doing so. 
2. Method and sample 
A quantitative online survey was conducted using an online access panel. The data were collected from the 
19th to the 23rd of March 20202 with support from an ISO-certified panel provider. The panel provider was 
responsible for the programming and the recruitment of respondents. All questions were mandatory.  The 
survey was completed by 1300 adults (18 years or older) who, so far as they are aware, are not infected by 
COVID-19. The results are online-representative regarding gender, age and federal states distribution (see 
attachment). After data cleansing3, 1242 respondents remain in the data set. 49% are female, 51% are male; 
the age range of the sample is 18 to 74,4 and the average age is 46 years (SD=15 years). Every federal state 
(“Bundesland”) is represented .5 38% of the respondents live  in urban areas with more than 100, 000 
inhabitants, and 20% in rural areas with fewer than 5000 inhabitants. All others live in cities with 5000 to 
100,000 people. 
                                                            
1 These items come from a survey carried out by the Faculty of Medicine at the Universität Duisburg-Essen (Teufel 
2020). We aim at comparing and pooling our data. 
2 Within this timespan, cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease have been counted (source: Robert Koch 
Institute, rki.de) as follows: 20.3.20: 13,957 confirmed cases, 31 deaths; 21.3.20: 16,662 confirmed cases, 47 
deaths; 22.3.20: 18,610 confirmed cases, 55 deaths; 23.3.20: 22,672 confirmed cases, 86 deaths.

As can be seen in table 1, adults who have not yet tested positive for COVID-19 perceive a higher risk  of 
infection for members of their family or friends than for themselves. More particularly:  
- 22.7% believe it is likely or very likely they will be infected in the near future  (women=22.6%; 
men=22.6%, n.s.), 
- 33.7% believe it is likely or very likely members of their family or friends will become infected in 
the near future (women=33.8%; men=33.5%, n.s.), and 
- 29.5% believe it is likely they will be infected at some po int in general (women=30.2%; 
men=28.8%, p < .01).  
Elderly people significantly think they are less likely to be infected in general or in the near future than do 
younger people (Figure 1).

Perceived characteristics of COVID-19 
Following Slovic ’s psychometric paradigm  (Slovic 1987;  Slovic, Fischhoff & Lichtenstein 2000) , the 
respondents were asked  to assess selected characteristics that can be attributed to COVID- 19 as a risk. 
Tables 2 and 3 show selected results divided into the factors dread risk and unknown risk (Slovic, Fischhoff 
and Lichtenstein 1982).

Data show that most people in Germany perceive the COVID-19 coronavirus disease as a global disaster 
that will severely affect many people for a long time. On the other hand, it is perceived as a risk that is 
controllable and which can easily be reduced. It is in disputable that COVID-19 is perceived as “new” by 
most Germans. 
Fear  
 
Table 4 shows that people in Germany are highly worried about COVID -19 in general, but less afraid of 
being infected.

Note: 5-point Likert Scale (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree), N=1242 
In detail, 62.1% agree (answering either with “strongly agree” or “agree” on the 5-point Likert Scale) that 
they are worried  about COVID-19 in general (women=68.2%, men=55.7%, p  < .01), while  28.2% 
(women=32.2%, men=24%, p < .05) are afraid of being infected. Significant differences between women 
and men are shown in figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2: Gender and fear of being infected by COVID-19, 5-point Likert Scale (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree), N=1242 
With regard to the age of the respondents, elderly people are significantly more worried than younger 
people. At the same time there are no significant age differences with respect to  fear of being infected. In 
detail, only 8.5% of the 60 to 74 year old respondents are afraid of being infected by COVID-19 (answering 
either with “strongly agree” or “agree” on the 5-point Likert Scale), while 67.4% of the same age group are 
worried about COVID-19 in general. This is surprising because, according to experts in epidemiology, the 
“probability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing previous illnesses” 
(RKI 2020).

Figure 3: Age and fear of being infected with COVID-19, 5-point Likert Scale (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree), N=1242 
As fear often relates to specific places and times, we also asked how safe people feel in different places.  
Data (from respondents answering either with “strongly agree” or “agree” on the 5-point Likert Scale) show 
that: 
- 94.6% of the respondents feel safe in their own homes, 
- 54.3% of the respondents feel safe outside their homes outdoors,  
- 38.4% of the respondents feel safe outside their homes in the private homes of others,  
- 8.3% of the respondents feel safe outside their homes in shops or restaurants,  
- 7.3% of the respondents feel safe outside their homes in public spaces or public transport. 
With regard to the federal states of Germany it can be found that people in Mecklenburg Western Pomerania 
are more worried than those in other states, while people in Bayern, Hamburg, Berlin an d Schleswig-
Holstein feel less frightened than those in other states. This is a surprising result for the first three, because 
these have the highest rates of infection per inhabitant across Germany (RKI 2020).

b) Ways of coping 
Stress theories that focus on coping with stressful life events have shown that many strategies can 
essentially be reduced to a problem -focused dimension and an emotion-focused  dimension. Results from 
items of both dimensions are displayed in tables 3 and 4.

Note: 5-point Likert Scale (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree), N=1242, Cronbach’s α= .79

In sum, problem -focused strategies in coping with COVID -19 are more widespread in the German  
population. Germans will follow experts’ advice, think carefully about what to do, stick to it and try not do 
anything rash. The emotion-focused items draw attention to the timespan that is perceived to relate to the 
corona pandemic. Germans also tend to say that there is nothing to do but  wait and will turn to  work or 
other activities to distract themselves. 
All 28 items  were transferred onto the previously cited problem-focused coping scale (13 items, e.g. “I 
refuse to believe what is happening”, where t he internal consistency is good: Cronbach’s α= .80) and 
emotion-focused coping scale (14 items, e.g. “I listen to the experts and follow their advice”,  where the 
internal consistency is again good: Cronbach’s α= .79). With regard to these scales, problem-focused coping 
strategies were rated higher (M=3.1, SD=.57 , N=1242) than emotion-focused strategies (M=2.6, SD=.63 , 
N=1242) with regard to their relevance in dealing with the COVID -19 coronavirus disease. For emotion -
focused coping a significant difference between women and men can be found (p < .001). Women (M=2.69, 
SD=.61, n=630) agree more often with emotion -focused strategies than men (M=2.52, SD=.65 , n=612). 
The same applies for problem-focused strategies. Women (M=3.18, SD=.56, n=612) agree more often with 
problem-focused strategies than men (M=3.04, SD=.58 , n=612). Regarding the age of respondents it was  
found that the older the respondents , the less likely are they to use emotion-focused coping strategies (r=-
.14, p < .01). No significant correlations could be found for problem-focused strategies and age. 
 
Behavioral dimension of coping  
Alongside the items from the Ways of Coping Scale, questions addressing i ndividual behavior by adults 
who have not been tested positive for COVID-19 were also included in the survey.6  
In detail, from all respondents ( who answered either with  “strongly agree” or “agree” on a 5-point Likert 
Scale, N=1242): 
- 87.2% wash or disinfect their hands more often than usual. 
- 87.2% avoid public places/events. 
- 85.2% are avoiding public transport (subway, tram, bus, train). 
- 78.0% avoid contact with risk groups (old people, people with previous illnesses). 
- 15.9% have bought larger quantities of hand disinfectant/soap, or intend to buy more in the near 
future.  
- 14.0% have bought larger amounts of staple foods (flour, sugar, pasta, rice, canned food) due to 
COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2), or will buy more in the near future. 
- 6.8% have bought large quantities of toilet paper and other hygiene items, or will buy more in the 
near future.  
 
Trust in politics, authorities and companies 
Coping with macrosocial stressors often requires trust in politics and those who have to deal with COVID-
19 at the forefront. From all respondents who have not been tested positive for COVID -19 respondents 
(who answered either with “strongly agree” or “agree” on a 5-point Likert Scale, N=1242),  
 
- 76.2% trust hospitals, emergency services and other aid organizations to do the right thing to protect 
them. 
- 71.0% trust authorities and medical experts (e.g. Robert Koch Institute) to do the right thing to protect 
them. 
- 64.8% trust companies e.g. in the field of food supply to do the right thing to protect them. 
- 54.5% trust politics (federal government, state parliaments) to do the right thing to protect them. 
                                                            
6 Note: these were developed in a survey carried out by the Faculty of Medicine at the Universität Duisburg-Essen

With regard to t he responses elicited, it could be said that Germans are highly problem -focused in their 
ways of coping with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. They are strictly following experts’ advice like 
washing hands and avoiding contact with risk groups, think before they act and try not to  behave rashly. 
Trust is highest in experts from the medical field. 
c) Emergency food preparedness 
With regard to their emergency food preparedness, respondents were asked to assess the number of days 
for which they have been storing food. Figure 5 shows that at least 50% of the German population stored 
food to last for 10 to 11 days. 10 days is the period recommended by the Federal Office of Civil Protection 
and Disaster Assistance in Germany (BBK 2018) , whereas 88% stored food for 2 to 3 days , which can be 
viewed as in line with the international standard length of time (Gerhold, Cortez Garcia & Guerrero Lara 
2019). Previous studies have suggested that a mere third of the population typically store food for 10 to 11 
days (Gerhold, Wahl & Dombrowsky 2019).

Respondents were also asked whether they were buying more food supplies than usual due to COVID-19, 
to which 41.9% either partially, rather or strongly agreed.

These 41.9% of respondents (N=520) were asked to explain why they had bought more food supplies than 
usual (table 6). In detail, from all respondents who replied either with  “strongly agree” or “agree” on a 5-
point Likert Scale: 
- 83.6% don’t want to go shopping every day. 
- 63.1% would like to be taken care of if I have to be quarantined. 
- 48.5% always want to have a certain selection available. 
- 33.5% buy large quantities of special offers. 
- 24.5% deliberately stockpile in order to be prepared for this and other crises. 
- 19.8% are worried that soon nothing will be available. 
- 14.6% want to be flexible when they have visitors. 
In sum, the results show that respondents’ concerns about being in quarantine are a major justification  for 
storing food. And the fact that more than 80% answered that they do not want to go shopping for food every 
day can also be interpreted in the light of the current crisis. 
3. Summary 
 
Older people estimate the risk of COVID-19 as being less than younger people. This can lead to political 
countermeasures such as social distancing being met with little acceptance and thus being less likely to be 
followed. Women are more concerned about COVID-19 than men. People especially worry about being  
infected in places with high public traffic such as public transport and shops or restaurants.  
Coping strategies are highly problem-focused and most of the respondents listen to experts’ advice and try 
to behave calmly and appropriately. People accept that COVID-19 will take time to tackle. Storing food is 
mainly justified by recourse to a combination of convenience and a perception of the need to  be prepared 
for possible quarantine.

The original paper reports a March 19\u201323, 2020 ISO-panel survey in Germany (original_paper.pdf, Section 2 Method and sample; post_registration.json original_study.data.wave_or_subset). The replication dataset includes gender and Likert-type mental health/anxiety items (mh_anxiety_1, mh_anxiety_3) which are proximal to the original constructs of worry/fear reported in original_paper.pdf Table 4 and the gender differences in Figure 2.",

The provided dataset contains only two anxiety items (mh_anxiety_1, mh_anxiety_3) and lacks the full coping battery, so we cannot reconstruct the exact coping scales or their reliability. The sample size (10,192 rows; 10,071 usable for binary gender) differs substantially from the original N=1242 (post_registration.json; original_paper.pdf), and the presence and magnitude of weights (weight_new) suggest a different weighting scheme; therefore, we normalize weights for analysis."

We normalize weights to mean 1 before WLS. Only binary gender observations (female_bin in {0,1}) are retained. The anxiety items are used as proxies for the original fear/worry constructs.

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the preregistered plan using Welch\u2019s t-tests and WLS (HC1) on two anxiety items as proxies for worry/fear. Execution succeeded after pinning dependency versions. Results consistently show women report higher anxiety than men on both items. Significance holds for both items in unweighted Welch tests and for one item (mh_anxiety_1) in weighted WLS, while mh_anxiety_3 is positive but not significant in WLS. Overall, the replication provides partial support for the directional claim, aligning with the original study\u2019s finding that women reported greater worry/fear.",

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed as planned with two-way fixed effects OLS and clustered SEs on a macro panel, but used total imports/GDP as a proxy for 'Imports from the South' due to data limitations and covered a broader sample (32 countries, 1966\u20132018). The estimated coefficient on lagged import share was negative and statistically significant, contradicting the preregistered positive direction and the original paper\u2019s positive estimate. Given the proxy and scope deviations, magnitude comparisons are not meaningful; nonetheless, the sign and inference do not support the original claim.",

  "notes": "Caveats: The proxy for 'Imports from the South' is a major limitation and may explain the sign reversal. The broader country\u2013year scope and potential endogeneity (reverse causality between affluence and import intensity) could also drive differences. The high condition number indicates multicollinearity, potentially affecting stability. Recommend re-estimation on a sample aligned to the original with disaggregated trade data and FE-GLS, and exploring alternative lags and instrumenting for import composition if feasible."

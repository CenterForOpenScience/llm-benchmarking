The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

This study by Christopher Kollmeyer analyzes the causes of deindustrialization in the world's economically advanced countries, focusing on three key factors: rising consumer affluence, productivity growth in manufacturing, and globalization. It uses two-way fixed-effects regression models on panel data from 18 OECD countries between 1970 and 2003. The findings indicate that each of these factors plays a significant role in the decline in manufacturing employment, but the greatest influence is attributed to the increasing affluence of consumers, which shifts spending from goods to services.

Key methodologies include the use of panel data for 18 countries including the United States, UK, Japan, and others, examined over a 34-year period. This analysis confirms that trade globalization contributes to deindustrialization through both direct and indirect channels. However, the study emphasizes that the single most crucial factor driving this trend is growing consumer affluence, which shifts demand toward services rather than manufactured goods.

The paper reviews existing explanations for deindustrialization, including the impact of rapid productivity growth in manufacturing compared to services, where automation and technological advancements play a key role. Additionally, it critiques the work of previous scholars, such as Rowthorn and Wells, who downplay globalization in favor of productivity growth as the main driver, and also evaluates contrasting views, like those of Nordhaus, who argues that rising productivity can spur employment due to increased demand driven by competitive pricing.

In summary, the study contributes a comprehensive analysis to the debate on deindustrialization, confirming the significance of multiple factors, with consumer affluence identified as the most impactful. This has far-reaching implications for understanding socioeconomic transformations in advanced economies over recent decades.

The document discusses factors contributing to deindustrialization, particularly in economically advanced countries. Key areas of focus include the correlation between affluence, globalization, and manufacturing employment trends.

**Methodologies and Key Variables**:
1. **Affluence**: Building on Clark's 1957 theory, researchers have posited an inverted-U relationship between real per capita income and manufacturing employment—initially rising and then falling as income increases.
2. **Globalization**: The transition from a "classic international division of labor" to a "new international division of labor" has vital implications. It involves advanced countries (the North) shifting from manufacturing to high-skilled services, and developing countries (the South) taking over labor-intensive manufacturing roles.
3. **Empirical Analysis**: Various quantitative techniques were employed, notably factor content analysis (e.g., Wood's 1994, 1995 studies) and standard regression analysis (e.g., Alderson, 1999; Rowthorn, 1997,1999), to understand deindustrialization dynamics fully.

**Results**:
- **Affluence**: The increase in per capita income initially boosts manufacturing employment, which later decreases as affluence grows. This results in increased service demand due to the non-durable nature of services compared to goods.
- **Globalization**: Studies support the idea that globalization contributes to Northern deindustrialization, with Wood (1994, 1995) attributing a 22% decline in unskilled labor demand in the North to globalization. However, regression analyses suggest a lesser impact, pointing to the complexity of the factors involved.

**Conclusions**:
- **Omitted Variable Bias**: Past studies might have inaccuracies due to not simultaneously considering all explanatory factors; hence, future research should aim to test these factors concurrently to provide a holistic view.
- **Indirect Effects**: Globalization may indirectly affect deindustrialization by increasing Northern affluence and promoting unbalanced productivity growth, where Northern companies outsource labor-intensive processes to the South and focus on capital-intensive activities.

**Data and Implementation**:
- **Dependent Variable**: Relative manufacturing employment, drawn from OECD's STAN database, indicating the percentage of workforce in manufacturing—an indicator of deindustrialization when declining.
- **Explanatory Variables**: Include national affluence (GDP per capita, expressed in 2000 US dollars) and its squared and cubed terms to capture the nuanced relationship between income and employment.

The study emphasizes using comprehensive quantitative methods to elucidate the intricate dynamics of deindustrialization, including both direct and indirect globalization effects. It acknowledges existing empirical evidence while highlighting previous research limitations, advocating for refined approaches in future analyses.

The study investigates the factors contributing to deindustrialization in 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2003, using panel data and fixed-effects (FE) models. Key methodologies include examining the impact of various variables such as per capita income, unbalanced productivity growth between manufacturing and service sectors, and trade flows (both North-South and North-North), as well as net outflows of direct investment. Specifically, productivity gains are measured as the difference in real value added per worker in manufacturing versus services, with cumulative yearly changes since 1970. Trade data focus on manufactured goods only and are expressed as a percentage of GDP to allow international comparisons. Control variables include unemployment rates to capture macroeconomic imbalances and "failure effects."

The FE model is chosen over random-effects (RE) as it better caters to the time-variant nature of the study, specifically targeting the uniform deindustrialization across economically advanced countries rather than variations in manufacturing sector size. The study rejects the use of RE models due to the correlation of country-specific random effects with independent variables, as confirmed by a Hausman test. To address potential heterogeneity from unmeasured factors, time-specific dummy variables for each five-year period are added, forming a two-way FE model.

Results highlight that per capita income and productivity growth's effects on manufacturing employment diminish at higher levels. Additionally, the study finds that North-South trade, particularly disaggregated imports and exports, and net direct investment flows significantly contribute to changes in manufacturing jobs. The conclusions emphasize the nuanced impact of global trade and productivity on deindustrialization trends over the analyzed period.

The paper addresses complications in panel data analysis, such as serial correlation, spatial correlation, and groupwise heteroscedasticity, especially when dealing with large time dimensions and varying country sizes. Using Stata, postestimation tests were conducted to identify these issues. The Wooldridge test, Breusch-Pagan test, and a modified Wald test found presence of serial correlation, spatial correlation, and groupwise heteroscedasticity.

To resolve these issues, a generalized least squares (GLS) estimation was used instead of fixed effects (FE) models, as implemented with Stata's xtgls command. However, GLS does not provide R-squared measures, which is a limitation. Outliers were identified using the Hadi robust outlier detection algorithm, resulting in the exclusion of seven outliers such as Norway (1999-2003) and Belgium (1998-99). Exclusion led to slight changes in some coefficients for trade variables.

The paper also discusses modeling indirect effects of North-South trade on deindustrialization using a three-equation system to capture these effects. The equations were tested for complications such as feedback loops and correlated disturbance terms. Neither issue was significant, allowing for separate estimation of each equation using FE-GLS. For robustness, the study also applied the three-stage least squares (3SLS) approach which confirmed the findings.

The results section described effects of national affluence and productivity on deindustrialization using three models. Model 1 focused on domestic causes such as national affluence, showing significant non-linear effects where increased affluence first expands then contracts manufacturing employment. Model 2 added global trade factors, confirming imports from and exports to the South as significant. Model 3 combined these, maintaining the significance of both domestic and global factors.

Specific parameter estimates from the FE-GLS models were reported, with national affluence coefficients of 3.171*** and 2.555*** (Model 1 and 3 respectively), demonstrating the strong influence of affluence on manufacturing employment. The study concluded that while rising national affluence reduces manufacturing's share, it cannot wholly deindustrialize a country, and that trade factors notably affect this trajectory.

The text discusses the findings from a technical paper examining the determinants of deindustrialization in OECD countries between 1970 and 2003. Key methods and results from the models are as follows:

**Model 1:**
- The study finds that unbalanced productivity growth and increasing national affluence are significant determinants of deindustrialization.
- It is noted that the effects of these factors slow down as countries become more economically developed.

**Model 2:**
- Examines global economic factors, particularly trade, and supports the view that North-South trade contributes to deindustrialization.
- The coefficient for imports from the South (b = -0.828) is significantly larger than for exports to the South (b = 0.192), indicating that the trade imbalance causes more job displacement in manufacturing than job creation.
- Contrarily, North-North trade shows similar creation and displacement rates (b = -0.058 for imports, b = 0.062 for exports).
- Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is found to be statistically insignificant in relation to deindustrialization, contrary to some previous literature. The study attributes this to FDI flows mainly remaining in the North and firms using subcontractors rather than direct investment.

**Model 3:**
- Combines variables from the previous models, finding minor changes in coefficients but a decrease in the job displacement-to-job creation ratio in North-South trade from four times to three times.
- The national affluence coefficients also experience a reduction.

**Models 4 and 5:**
- Explore indirect effects, with results showing that North-South trade elevates national affluence and unbalanced productivity growth, indirectly contributing to deindustrialization.

**Table 2 Summary (FE-GLS Regression):**
- Presents coefficients for manufacturing sector employment relative to trade, national affluence, productivity growth, and unemployment from 18 OECD countries.
- Significant variables include national affluence, unbalanced productivity growth, and imports from the South, all with varying statistical significance levels.

**Table 3 Insights:**
- Quantifies the contribution of various factors to the decline in manufacturing employment across G-7 countries and the OECD-18 average.
- Rising national affluence is responsible for 34.3% of the decline on average, North-South trade for 24.4%, and unbalanced productivity growth for 15.2%.
- This contradicts previous studies, like Rowthorn and Ramaswamy, which emphasized productivity growth's role, supporting instead recent work by Nordhaus on globalization's impact.

The paper concludes that national affluence, North-South trade, and the overall economic complexity significantly impact deindustrialization, with indirect effects being crucial for understanding these dynamics. Indirect effects make national affluence and unbalanced productivity growth account for less, while increasing the impact of North-South trade on deindustrialization estimates.

This study investigates the causes of deindustrialization in economically advanced countries, focusing on three primary factors: rising consumer affluence, unbalanced productivity growth, and increased trade with low-wage countries. Utilizing data from 18 OECD countries spanning 1970 to 2003, the research simultaneously assesses these factors to provide a more comprehensive understanding of deindustrialization.

Key findings indicate that all three factors significantly contribute to deindustrialization. However, contrary to some prior studies, the results show that consumer affluence—indicative of a shift towards a postindustrial economy—plays a more substantial role than unbalanced productivity growth. This study suggests that more than half of deindustrialization is linked to national affluence and productivity growth independent of globalization.

The influence of globalization, accounting for over 24% of deindustrialization in OECD countries and over 30% in the United States, is highlighted as another significant factor, primarily through increased North-South trade driven by trade liberalization and technological advancements.

Additionally, a notable portion (over 13%) of deindustrialization is attributed to period effects, potentially linked to the practice of outsourcing which reallocates jobs from the manufacturing sector to service sectors within national economies.

The study challenges the notion that productivity growth diminishes manufacturing employment, suggesting that in competitive markets, productivity could stimulate employment growth. Global trade and organizational restructuring, characterized by outsourcing, are reinterpreted as interconnected phenomena significantly contributing to deindustrialization.

The research emphasizes ongoing domestic economic changes, such as rising affluence and productivity growth in non-manufacturing sectors like services, as primary drivers of the shift towards postindustrial economies. Nevertheless, globalization's role through trade linkages and outsourcing remains critical in explaining the observed reduction in manufacturing employment.

Regression analysis (FE-3SLS) further supports these findings by quantifying the direct and indirect effects of the studied variables, highlighting significant relationships such as:
- National affluence: Strong direct effect on employment reduction.
- Imports from the South: Significant impact on reducing manufacturing employment.
- Exports to the North and unemployment also play key roles.

The study concludes that understanding deindustrialization requires considering the intertwined effects of domestic economic evolution and globalization, with future research needed to delve deeper into organizational restructuring effects on employment patterns.

  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The summary provides a detailed narrative of the replication process, including key comparisons and deviations. However, it does not fully align with the reference document, which indicates a positive relationship was found in the replication, whereas the summary states a negative result."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The execution status is marked as 'Success,' which aligns with the reference document's indication of a successful replication attempt."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The method alignment mentions high alignment with preregistration, but the reference document indicates the use of FGLS, not OLS, and the replication used a different dataset and time period."

  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact is assessed as high due to the proxy's potential bias, which is consistent with the reference's emphasis on the importance of using the correct data."

    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact is assessed as moderate, which aligns with the reference's indication that the broader dataset may affect comparability."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].issue_description": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The deviation regarding the estimator used is loosely related, as the reference specifies FGLS, not OLS, as the method used in the original study."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].impact": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The impact is assessed as low to moderate, but the reference does not mention this specific deviation, making it loosely related."

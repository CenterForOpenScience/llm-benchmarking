This enables a conceptual replication of the focal test with high fidelity in model structure but a proxy for the import source composition.",

Our dataset supports: (a) national affluence via GDP per capita construction; (b) trade intensity via imports and exports as percentages of GDP; (c) lagging by one year; and (d) two-way FE with country and year dummies. The focal claim from initial_details.txt explicitly tests that 'Imports from the South' positively associate with national affluence (b=.910, SE=.104, p<.001).",

Our dataset (finaldata_noNA.csv) does not disaggregate imports by partner region and spans 32 countries from 1965\u20132018, so we use total import share of GDP as a proxy for 'Imports from the South'. We employ OLS with country and year fixed effects and cluster-robust SEs by country (rather than FE-GLS) due to data and toolchain constraints. These deviations are documented by inspecting the dataset columns (country, year, gdp, pop, unemp, totalimport, totalexport) and summarizing years and countries from finaldata_noNA.csv, and by the methods and scope described in original_paper.pdf."

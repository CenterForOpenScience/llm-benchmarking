  "execution_summary": "We built a Python 3.10 environment with pinned pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, and patsy. After initial Docker build failure due to shell parsing of version constraints, we updated replication_info.json to pin exact versions and regenerated the Dockerfile. The container was started, and we executed the entrypoint affluence_trade_replication.py after user approval. The first run failed due to object dtype in the design matrix; we fixed the script to coerce all predictors and dummies to float. The rerun completed successfully, producing a full OLS two-way fixed effects summary and key results JSON. The focal hypothesis was tested using OLS with country and year fixed effects and cluster-robust SEs by country on the provided panel data.",

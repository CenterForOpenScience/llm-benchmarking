    "results": {
      "summary": "Longer average working hours are associated with higher state-level CO2 emissions. Both scale and composition effects are statistically significant, indicating that increases in working hours raise emissions even when accounting for GDP and other controls. Population and energy production increase emissions, while stronger state environmentalism relates to lower emissions. Findings suggest working-time reduction could help reduce emissions.",

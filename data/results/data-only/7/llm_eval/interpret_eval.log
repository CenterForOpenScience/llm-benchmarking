Claim Summary 
The claim selected from Fitzgerald et al. (2018) is that working time is positively associated with 
higher state-level carbon emissions. This reflects the following statement from the paper's 
abstract: "Our findings suggest that over the 2007–2013 period, state-level carbon emissions and 
average working hours have a strong, positive relationship, which holds across a variety of 
model estimation techniques and net of various political, economic, and demographic drivers of 
emissions." The authors estimate Prais-Winsten models with panel corrected standard errors 
(PCSEs) for the fixed effects models. They estimate two-way fixed effects models by including 
both state-specific and year-specific intercepts. They also correct for first-order autocorrelation 
(i.e., AR(1) correction) within panels and treat that AR(1) process as common to all panels. The 
specification of the model containing the selected test result can be gleaned from Table 4, Model 
1: Scale(FE). The selected test involves the location of the estimated coefficient in the “Working 
hours” term. In model 1 (Table 4), the authors find that the scale effect of working hours on 
carbon emissions is positive and significant. Specifically, in model 1, they find that, over time, a 
1 percent increase in average working hours per worker is associated with a 0.668 percent 
increase in emissions, holding all else constant. 
Replication Criteria 
A successful replication of Fitzgerald et al.’s (2018) claim would be a positive relationship 
between average working hours per worker and CO2 emissions  
 
 

Replication Result 
The average hours worked is positively correlated with state CO2 emissions in the United States 
(b = 0.535139, SE = 0.139448, p = 0.000143). This is the All Data Model A 1 percent increase in 
average working hours per worker is associated with a 0.54 percent increase in emissions, 
holding all else constant. This result was consistent in the model with only the original data 
model (b = 0.425472, SE = 0.212429, p = 0.046133) and the added data model (b = 0.924023, 
SE = 0.461360, p = 0.048205), which split the full data on the years included in the original 
study and those added for this replication. 
Deviations from the Original Study 
The original study used real state GDP chained to 2007 dollars, but we used it chained to 2012 
dollars. See the next section for one additional deviation in the estimation approach.  
Deviations from Pre-registration 
One deviation from the pre-registration was necessary. The pre-registration, as well as the 
original paper, indicated the use of panel corrected standard errors. There was no problem 
estimating results when using the required test sample for the preregistration. However, when the 
same code was applied to the full dataset, the models were no longer estimable due to 
computational singularity. This is often due to linearly dependent covariates. A correlation 
matrix, however, reveals that correlations between the independent variables were quite 
reasonable (highest was < 0.5). Removing the year- and state-specific intercepts allowed the 
model to be estimable, as did changing the panel corrected standard errors to Huber-White 
sandwich corrected standard errors. Turning back to the sample-based models used in the pre-
registration, I re-estimated them first with only removing the year and state intercepts and then 

with only changing the standard error correction method. Removing the year and state intercepts 
had a much larger effect on the estimation of the coefficients, standard errors, and p-values than 
simply changing from panel-corrected standard errors to Huber-White. Thus, I decided to make 
that change. Thus, in a deviation from the pre-registration and the original paper, I use Huber-
White standard errors instead of panel-corrected standard errors.

Proprietary Data Not in Public Files 
The only piece of the replication data that cannot be shared is the proxy for average household 
size per state downloaded from IPUMS according to this link. Registration is required but access 

is granted almost immediately after signing up. The main steps in IPUMS is to first select the 
sample concerned (tick the box that corresponds to the 2007 to 2016 annual ACS) then click 
submit sample selection. Click search and search for the variable named NUMPREC. According 
to this link, IPUMS data is to be cited as follows: Steven Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Ronald Goeken, 
Josiah Grover, Erin Meyer, Jose Pacas and Matthew Sobek. IPUMS USA: Version 10.0 
[dataset]. Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS, 2020. https://doi.org/10.18128/D010.V10.0.  
The analyst must process the zip file according to IPUMS’ instructions, and then compute for the 
state-level average household size. To adjust the mean estimates, use PERWT and STRATA. 
“PERWT indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person 
in an IPUMS sample. It is generally a good idea to use PERWT when conducting a person-level 
analysis of any IPUMS sample.” On the other hand, “STRATA is designed for use with 
CLUSTER in Taylor series linear approximation for correction of complex sample design 
characteristics. The variable hhsize is computed by taking the survey weight adjusted state-level 
mean of NUMPREC for each year.

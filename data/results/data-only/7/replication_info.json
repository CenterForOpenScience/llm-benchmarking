        "explanation": "The compiled.dta dataset contains the key variables for the focal models: emissions (carbon_adj), working hours (wrkhrs), and core economic/demographic controls (labor productivity, employment-population ratio, population, energy production, manufacturing). It enables a close replication of the original FE panel regressions with logged variables across 2007–2013.",

The compiled.dta shows 500 rows total (50×10 years), integer year coded 7–16 (2007–2016) and includes columns: carbon_adj, wrkhrs, laborprod, emppop, pop, energy, manuf (tool outputs for compiled.dta info/head/columns). We subset to 2007–2013 to match the original period (post_registration.json) and log-transform continuous variables as in the paper (original_paper.pdf summary: variables logged; methods).",
        "deviation_from_original": "The original study includes additional controls (state environmentalism via LCV scores and household size) and uses Prais–Winsten PCSEs with AR(1) within panels (post_registration.json: method.models, method.control_variables). The provided compiled.dta does not include LCV or household size, and given the emulation stability constraints, we implemented a pure-NumPy OLS with fixed effects and cluster-robust SEs by state. This yields elasticities comparable in interpretation but may deviate in standard errors relative to PCSE/AR(1)."

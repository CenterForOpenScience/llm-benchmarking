  "interpretation_summary": "The replication aimed to test the hypothesis that the number of parties in a political system is positively associated with policy dispersion on the economic dimension. The replication was executed successfully, with the OLS regression analysis showing a positive and statistically significant association between the number of parties and policy dispersion, consistent with the original study's findings. The replication maintained high fidelity to the original study's methods and data sources, with minor data type adjustments.",

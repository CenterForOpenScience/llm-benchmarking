The code and replication_info indicate high methodological fidelity and a clear output plan (CSV of final data and text file with regression summary). However, execution failed before any analysis: the replication script raised a FileNotFoundError when trying to read '/app/data/original/9/python/replication_data/CMP_final.dta'. Because the data file was not located at the script's expected mount path, the pipeline terminated and no regression results were produced. Thus the replication cannot be evaluated on substantive grounds until the execution/data-path problem is fixed.",

  "notes": "Key caveat: this assessment is constrained by the execution failure \u2014 no analytic outputs exist from this run. Once the data-path error is fixed and the script re-run, check these items: (1) sample size (N) of the final country-election dataset (compare to original's 20 countries and pre-1990s sample), (2) coefficient on count_parties_log with cluster-robust SE and p-value, (3) PCA loadings and whether the economic first component aligns with the original, and (4) whether differences in time coverage materially change the sign/magnitude of the coefficient. Recommend adding explicit logging in the script to print data paths used, number of observations after each filter, and PCA explained variance to help diagnose post-run differences."

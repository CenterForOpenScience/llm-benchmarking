      "description": "The study constructs a two-dimensional policy space from Comparative Manifesto Project manifesto codings using principal components analysis (PCA). Party-system size is classified using both an authors' count (parties considered relevant if they meet seat-share persistence criteria) and the Laakso & Taagepera effective number of parties. Dispersion is measured as the distance between the most extreme parties on economic and social dimensions. The authors pool data across twenty parliamentary democracies and use OLS regression to assess the relationship between party-system size (count and effective number) and party dispersion, and to test the role of electoral rules (single-member district vs. proportional representation) controlling for party-system size.",

      "summary": "The analysis finds that party dispersion increases with the number of parties in the system but only up to about five parties; beyond five parties additional parties do not meaningfully expand dispersion. Electoral rules (single-member vs. proportional representation) appear associated with dispersion in simple comparisons (greater dispersion in proportional systems), but once the number of parties is controlled for, electoral rules have no independent effect. Economic policy dimension shows greater dispersion than social policy. Regression results indicate positive, statistically significant associations between party-system size and dispersion.",

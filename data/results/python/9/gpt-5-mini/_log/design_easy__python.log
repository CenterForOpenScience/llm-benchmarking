2. ./data/original/9/python/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. ./data/original/9/python/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
4. ./data/original/9/python/replication_data: The folder containing the data that can potentially be used for the replication. There may also be useful code to help you with the replication. But if not, you have to generate the replication code yourself in Python.

[CLAIM]
The authors find that as the number of parties in the system increases, party dispersion increases and the effect is statistically significant for both policy dimensions (coefficient on log count of parties in system term = 0.39, robust SE clustered by country = 0.14, coefficient falls within a 95% confidence interval)

[HYPOTHESIS]
On the economic policy dimension, the number of parties in the party system is positively associated with policy dispersion.

2026-02-05 11:32:27,485 - replication - INFO - ***Agent output (Thought):
Thought: I inspected the study folder, the provided Stata do-file, and the two data files (CMP_final.dta and CPDS_final.dta). The available data contain the required variables (CMP perXXX indicators, absseat, totseats, countryname, edate, party; CPDS contains prop and year). I translated the Stata .do into a Python script located at ./data/original/9/python/replication_data/Andrews_Money_Replication__py.py that implements the same sequence of operations (party filtering rules, PCA on the economic indicators, compute dispersion between extreme parties, log transforms, lag, and OLS with clustered SE). Below is the completed replication_info.json describing the planned replication, the dataset qualification (similarities and deviations), analysis plan, codebase, docker specs, and instructions to run the replication.

Answer:
{
  "replication_study": {
    "hypothesis": "On the economic policy dimension, party-system size (log count of relevant parties) is positively associated with party dispersion (log distance between the two most extreme parties) after controlling for electoral system type and lagged dispersion.",
    "study_type": "Observational",
    "data_plan": {
      "dataset_identifier": "CMP_final.dta & CPDS_final.dta (provided in ./data/original/9/python/replication_data/)",
      "source_type": "Archival / comparative manifesto data (party manifestos) merged with comparative political system data",
      "wave_or_subset": "All observations included in the supplied CMP_final.dta and CPDS_final.dta (CMP party manifestos pooled across multiple countries and elections; CPDS includes country-year electoral rule info). The original study used elections from post-WWII through the 1990s (post_registration.json). The provided data files include observations up through 2019 (see CPDS_final.dta \"year\" values and data content).",
      "sample_size": "To be computed precisely by executing the replication script. The original study pooled party observations across 20 parliamentary democracies (post_registration.json). The replication dataset supplied contains many countries and years (CPDS_final.dta contains country-year rows from 1945 through 2019). The final sample (country-election level) after the party inclusion filters and removing non-positive dispersions will be output by the replication script to /app/data/Andrews_Money_replication_data.csv and can be inspected for exact N.",
      "unit_of_analysis": "Country-election (party-system) level for regressions; original party-level data used to construct party positions but dispersion and regressions are at the country-election level.",
      "access_details": "Data files are supplied locally in the repository under ./data/original/9/python/replication_data/. No external access or special requests are required for these supplied files.",
      "qualification": {
        "explanation": "The provided CMP_final.dta and CPDS_final.dta include the manifest coding indicators and electoral-system variables needed to reconstruct PCA-based party positions, compute dispersion between extremes, and create party-count measures using the authors' seat-share persistence rules. The available variables and code implement the same logic the original authors described (party seat thresholds, PCA on specific CMP categories, dispersion as distance between most extreme parties, log transforms, and OLS with clustered SE). Sources: the original replication do-file included in ./data/original/9/python/replication_data/Andrews-Money_Replication.do (implements the exact steps), and post_registration.json (documents original data source and steps).",
        "similarity_to_original": "High-fidelity elements: (1) Same CMP coding categories for the economic PCA are present (per303, per401, per402, per403, per404, per407, per412, per413, per414, per504, per505, per701) — see the Stata do-file at ./data/original/9/python/replication_data/Andrews-Money_Replication.do and CMP_final.dta variable list (./data/original/9/python/replication_data/CMP_final.dta). (2) The party-inclusion rule (party with >=1% seats in at least two consecutive elections and not failed in three subsequent elections) is implemented per the do-file (same file). (3) The dispersion measure (distance between the two most extreme parties on the economic PCA dimension) and its log transform are constructed as in the do-file and described in post_registration.json.",
        "deviation_from_original": "Deviations: (1) Time coverage: post_registration.json states the original analysis used elections up through the 1990s; the supplied CPDS_final.dta and CMP_final.dta include observations through 2019 (see CPDS_final.dta 'year' values and long data content), which means the replication covers a longer time span and is thus a different sample (more recent elections). (2) PCA implementation detail: the Python script standardizes PCA inputs (mean zero, unit variance) prior to computing the first component using scikit-learn PCA to approximate Stata's pca behavior; small numeric differences relative to Stata's output are possible. (3) Implementation choices: minor implementation differences in handling of parties with missingness and exact edge cases might differ subtly from Stata's internal handling. Evidence of original waves and timeframe is in post_registration.json; the do-file used is at ./data/original/9/python/replication_data/Andrews-Money_Replication.do; the replication data files are ./data/original/9/python/replication_data/CMP_final.dta and ./data/original/9/python/replication_data/CPDS_final.dta."
      },
      "notes": "Caveats and potential issues: (1) PCA differences: Stata's pca behavior (centering/scaling default) may differ slightly from scikit-learn; this can cause minor numeric differences in party scores. I standardized variables prior to PCA to approximate correlation-based PCA but note this as a deviation. (2) Observations with non-positive dispersion (e.g., identical min and max due to missing scores) are dropped before log-transform; this reproduces the conceptual requirement but may slightly change sample size. (3) The do-file uses some temporary intermediate files (election_identifier.dta etc.); the Python script implements these steps in-memory and stores final outputs under /app/data as required. (4) All IO in the Python script uses /app/data paths, consistent with the run policy."

If multiple outcomes (e.g., social dimension) are tested, correction methods (Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg) should be applied; for this replication the main test is unadjusted, matching the original study's focal analysis.",

Dependencies must be installed in the runtime environment (see docker_specs).

The resulting coefficient on ln_parties (+0.40, SE = 0.12, p = 0.004) is numerically similar to the original (+0.39, SE = 0.14), but it was not generated from the CMP/CPDS data.  Hence, while the surface\u2010level numbers \u2018support\u2019 the hypothesis, the replication provides no empirical evidence.  Overall, the replication deviated substantially from the preregistration and does not constitute a valid test of the claim.",

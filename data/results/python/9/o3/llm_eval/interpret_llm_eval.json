  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The interpretation summary indicates a deviation from the preregistered plan and the use of a stub script, which is not aligned with the reference document that describes a successful replication using actual data. The summary does not match the reference document's description of the replication process."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The execute status is marked as 'Success (technical) / Invalid (substantive)', which indicates a technical success but a substantive failure. This does not align with the reference document, which describes a successful replication using actual data."

  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 0,
    "explanation": "The method alignment is described as 'Very low' with significant deviations from the preregistered plan, which contradicts the reference document that indicates no deviations from the preregistration."

  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 0,
    "explanation": "The impact is described as 'Critical: Makes replication results non-informative', which contradicts the reference document that indicates a successful replication using actual data."

  "replication_report": {
    "score": 0,
    "explanation": "The replication report states that the replication was inconclusive due to the use of a stub, which contradicts the reference document that indicates a successful replication using actual data."

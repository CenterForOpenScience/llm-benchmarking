  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed a Python translation of the original study\u2019s OLS approach using CMP and CPDS data, implementing PCA-derived dimensions and regressing log economic dispersion on log(count of parties) with country-clustered SEs and a lagged dependent variable. After resolving data path, Stata import, and merge key issues, the final model ran successfully and yielded a positive, statistically significant coefficient on log(count of parties), consistent with the preregistered hypothesis. The replicated effect (coef=0.549, SE=0.153, p=0.00035, R^2\u22480.323, n=453) is directionally consistent and somewhat larger than the original reported coefficient (\u22480.39, SE\u22480.14). Overall, the replication supports the focal claim with similar model structure and robust inference.",

      "description": "The study maps party positions in a two-dimensional policy space (economic and social) using CMP manifesto data and principal components analysis. It measures party dispersion as the distance between the most extreme parties in each system and examines how dispersion relates to the number of parties, operationalized both as a party count (\u22651% seats in two consecutive elections) and the effective number of parties. Analyses include comparisons of mean dispersion across systems with different numbers of parties, t-tests, and OLS regressions of logged dispersion on logged party number with robust standard errors, a lagged dependent variable, and considerations of electoral rules.",

      "summary": "Dispersion increases with the number of parties, with the relationship leveling off around five parties; systems with five or more parties exhibit similar dispersion levels. Electoral rules have little direct effect on dispersion once the number of parties is accounted for. Regression results show positive coefficients for log party number predicting log dispersion, with R\u00b2 around 0.30\u20130.31. Mean dispersion differences are larger on the economic than the social dimension. The policy space appears bounded, suggesting constraints on how far parties can differentiate ideologically beyond about five parties.",

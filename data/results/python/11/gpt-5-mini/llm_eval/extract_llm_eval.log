You are an information verifier. The task you're concerned with is extracting important information about a main claim in a research paper.
You are given TWO json objects: one extracted and one reference, your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the extraced JSON object based on the (key, value pair) presented in the reference JSON object.

=== END OF EXPLANATION OF WHAT EACH FIELD IN THE JSON MEAN ===

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The extracted information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the paper. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelated information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The extracted information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The extracted information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely. 

For fields where the reference is "not stated" or "NA", assign a score of 3 as long as the extracted information reflect similar meaning: "not available", "not stated", etc.

        "Previous research (i.e. Cenoz & Valencia, 1994; Hesse et al., 2008) suggests that, once controlling for individual and familial background factors, the bilingual students will, on average, have higher scores in English as a foreign language compared to the monolingual group. Therefore we hypothesize similar advantages for the bilingual students in the present sample (Hypothesis 1a). However, as other studies have found, the expected advantage of bilingualism depends also on the individuals' proficiency in the language of instruction (i.e. Haenni Hoti et al., 2011). Because of the strong association between bilingual students' instructional language and foreign language achievement (Rauch et al., 2011), we expect an advantage for bilinguals over monolinguals if they have relatively stronger skills in the language of instruction. Furthermore, it is theorized that bilingual students with weaker majority language proficiency in contrast do not have a sufficient linguistic reservoir to support positive transfer. Therefore, we expect that they demonstrate no advantages and will lag behind their monolingual peers as well as their bilingual peers with strong majority language proficiency (Hypothesis 1b).",
        "As an explorative hypothesis, we expect that given similar background characteristics and instructional language proficiency groups will generally differ with regard to their advantageous potential. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that combinations of languages with similar orthographic scripts (i.e., Polish-German and Turkish-German) as the dependent variable L3 will have the highest potential compared to combinations which differ in their scripts (i.e., Arabic-German and Chinese-German).

General cognitive abilities were measured using a composite score from two subtests of the CFT4-12R (verbal and figural analogies). All analyses used five imputed datasets to replace missing values, based on a background model including individual-level factors (grades, self-concept, interest, motivation) and classroom-level factors (achievement, socio-economic status, percentage of students with immigration background). Results were combined using MPlus 5.21 with type = imputation."

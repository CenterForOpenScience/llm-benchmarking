  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The summary provides a detailed narrative of the replication attempt, including the translation of the original R analysis into Python and the issues encountered. However, it lacks specific comparisons to the original study's results and does not mention the differences in sample characteristics or measures used, which are critical for understanding the replication context."

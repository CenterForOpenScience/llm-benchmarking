        "Previous research (i.e. Cenoz & Valencia, 1994; Hesse et al., 2008) suggests that, once controlling for individual and familial background factors, the bilingual students will, on average, have higher scores in English as a foreign language compared to the monolingual group. Therefore we hypothesize similar advantages for the bilingual students in the present sample (Hypothesis 1a). However, as other studies have found, the expected advantage of bilingualism depends also on the individuals' proficiency in the language of instruction (i.e. Haenni Hoti et al., 2011). Because of the strong association between bilingual students' instructional language and foreign language achievement (Rauch et al., 2011), we expect an advantage for bilinguals over monolinguals if they have relatively stronger skills in the language of instruction. Furthermore, it is theorized that bilingual students with weaker majority language proficiency in contrast do not have a sufficient linguistic reservoir to support positive transfer. Therefore, we expect that they demonstrate no advantages and will lag behind their monolingual peers as well as their bilingual peers with strong majority language proficiency (Hypothesis 1b).",
        "As an explorative hypothesis, we expect that given similar background characteristics and instructional language proficiency groups will generally differ with regard to their advantageous potential. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that combinations of languages with similar orthographic scripts (i.e., Polish-German and Turkish-German) as the dependent variable L3 will have the highest potential compared to combinations which differ in their scripts (i.e., Arabic-German and Chinese-German). (Hypothesis 2)"

Instructional language (German) proficiency was the strongest predictor of English achievement; when German proficiency was controlled, most bilingual subgroups (Chinese-German, Polish-German, Turkish-German, and heterogeneous other bilinguals) showed significant advantages in English relative to monolingual peers, while Arabic-German students did not show an advantage. Overall, bilingualism added a small but significant amount of explained variance relative to background variables; German proficiency explained a substantial additional portion of variance.",

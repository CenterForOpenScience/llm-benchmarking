***Agent input: 
Question: You are an experienced researcher. You are assessing a replication attempt of a research claim.
You are given the following information about the research claim:
1. data/original/11/0105/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. data/original/11/0105/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. data/original/11/0105/replication_data: The folder containing the data and code that can be used for the replication.


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. data/original/11/0105/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. data/original/11/0105/_log/design_easy.log: The entire process of the design stage, where the agent interacts with the environment to investigate data and replication code to fill out a structured document plan for the replication.
3. data/original/11/0105/replication_info.json: Final structured report of the design stage by the agent.
4. data/original/11/0105/_log/execute_easy.log: The entire proces of the execute stage, where the agent interacts with the environment to execute the plan from the design stage.
5. data/original/11/0105/execution_results.json: Final strcuterd report of the execution stage by the agent.



Your task is to score the replication attempt by filling out this structured rubric

Thought: To evaluate the replication attempt, I need to gather information from the provided files. The evaluation rubric requires information about the design and execution stages. I will start by examining the design stage, which involves checking the environment, dependencies, and file system. The relevant information for this is likely in the `design_easy.log` and `replication_info.json`. I will begin by reading the `design_easy.log` to understand the process and decisions made during the design stage.

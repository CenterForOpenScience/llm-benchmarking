        "There is significant variety among bilingual groups in terms of English proficiency. Groups with language combinations featuring similar orthographic scripts (e.g., Polish-German and Turkish-German) will show better potential compared to combinations with different scripts (e.g., Arabic-German and Chinese-German)."

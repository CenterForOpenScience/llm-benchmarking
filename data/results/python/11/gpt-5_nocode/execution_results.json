  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10 environment via Docker and executed a Python replication pipeline against an RDS dataset mounted at /app/data. The original code attempted to detect 'English WLE' and 'bilingual' variables but failed on this dataset (international FL dataset schema). I rewrote the Python entrypoint to include dataset-specific fallbacks: outcome as the row-wise mean of plausible values PV[1-5]_READ; bilingual as I03_ST_A_S26B (0/1). Controls were mapped to HISEI (socio-economic status), PARED (parental education), SQt21i01 (books at home) with special ordinal handling, and SQt01i01 (gender). Missing data were handled via IterativeImputer (m=5). Final model used OLS with HC1 robust SEs (no class cluster available). Execution completed successfully, writing replication_results.json and replication_results.txt. The pooled bilingual coefficient was positive and statistically significant. This approach aligns with the preregistered focal test (bilingual advantage controlling for background), but differs by using PV-means for English and not including cognitive/German proficiency due to lack of direct mappings in this dataset.",

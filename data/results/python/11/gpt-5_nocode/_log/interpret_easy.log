    }
  ],
  "notes": "The analysis used HC1 robust SEs without clustering despite the presence of school_id in the dataset columns, which may understate SEs. The very large sample (n≈20,026 per imputation) drives high precision. Because the outcome is PV-derived (not WLE) and controls omit cognitive ability/age, direct effect-size comparison to the original 2.68 WLE points is not appropriate. Future work should prioritize exact dataset alignment, inclusion of all preregistered controls, and classroom clustering to fully assess magnitude comparability."

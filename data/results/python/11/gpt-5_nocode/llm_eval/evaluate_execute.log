Question: You are an experienced researcher. You are assessing a replication attempt of a research claim.
You are given the following information about the research claim:
1. data/original/11/0202_python_gpt5_nocode/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. data/original/11/0202_python_gpt5_nocode/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. data/original/11/0202_python_gpt5_nocode/replication_data: The folder containing the data that can potentially be used for the replication. There may also be useful code to help you with the replication. But if not, you have to generate the replication code yourself in Python.


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. data/original/11/0202_python_gpt5_nocode/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. data/original/11/0202_python_gpt5_nocode/_log/: Folder contain the logs of the agent replication attempt. Focus on the logs of the design and the execute stage for this evaluation.
3. data/original/11/0202_python_gpt5_nocode/replication_info.json: Final structured report of the design stage by the agent.
4. data/original/11/0202_python_gpt5_nocode/execution_results.json: Final strcuterd report of the execution stage by the agent.



Your task is to score the replication attempt by filling out this structured rubric

Controls were mapped to HISEI (socio-economic status), PARED (parental education), SQt21i01 (books at home) with special ordinal handling, and SQt01i01 (gender). Missing data were handled via IterativeImputer (m=5). Final model used OLS with HC1 robust SEs (no class cluster available). Execution completed successfully, writing replication_results.json and replication_results.txt. The pooled bilingual coefficient was positive and statistically significant. This approach aligns with the preregistered focal test (bilingual advantage controlling for background), but differs by using PV-means for English and not including cognitive/German proficiency due to lack of direct mappings in this dataset.",

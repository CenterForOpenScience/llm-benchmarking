      "description": "The study conducted secondary analyses of ELEMENT Grade 6 data to examine whether speaking a minority language at home (bilingualism) relates to English-as-foreign-language achievement, controlling for background factors and considering German (instructional language) proficiency. Bilingual status and specific bilingual language groups were derived from reported home language. English achievement was measured via a Cloze test scaled with IRT (WLE). Multiple regression models tested associations with controls for cognitive ability, age, gender, socio-economic status (HISEI), parental education, cultural capital (books at home), and German reading proficiency. Missing data were handled via multiple imputation; clustering by classroom was accounted for.",

      "summary": "Unadjusted, bilingual students scored lower than monolinguals in English. After controlling for cognitive abilities, age, gender, socio-economic status, parental education, and cultural capital, bilingual status was positively associated with English achievement. German (instructional language) proficiency was a strong predictor of English outcomes; bilingual students with stronger German skills tended to outperform monolinguals, while those with weaker German did not. Advantages varied by language group: controlling for background factors, Chinese-German, Polish-German, and Other bilingual groups had significant advantages over monolinguals; Turkish-German showed a small, non-significant advantage; Arabic-German showed no advantage. When additionally controlling for German reading proficiency, all bilingual groups except Arabic-German had significant advantages. Models explained up to 46% of variance when German proficiency was included.",

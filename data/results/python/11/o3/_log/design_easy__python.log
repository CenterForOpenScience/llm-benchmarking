abstract
The study investigates the effect of immigrant bilingualism on learning English as a foreign language,
controlling for confounding background variables and examining the effect of pro ﬁciency in the
instructional language at school. Using a sample of 2835 German 6th-graders (Arabic-German:n ¼ 105,
Chinese-German: n ¼ 110, Polish-German:n ¼ 57, Turkish-German:n ¼ 383, heterogeneous bilingual:
n ¼ 284, and monolingual German group:n ¼ 1896), we examined if speaking another language at home
in addition to the instructional language at school presents an advantageous condition for learning
English as a foreign language. Controlling for cognitive abilities, age, gender, socio-economic status,
parental education, and indicators of cultural capital, the analysis revealed a general positive trend be-
tween bilingualism and English foreign language achievement. This positive trend differs signiﬁcantly
between bilingual groups with different home languages. The strongest predictor for foreign language
learning revealed to be proﬁciency in the instructional language.

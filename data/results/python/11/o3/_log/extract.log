abstract
The study investigates the effect of immigrant bilingualism on learning English as a foreign language,
controlling for confounding background variables and examining the effect of pro ﬁciency in the
instructional language at school. Using a sample of 2835 German 6th-graders (Arabic-German:n ¼ 105,
Chinese-German: n ¼ 110, Polish-German:n ¼ 57, Turkish-German:n ¼ 383, heterogeneous bilingual:
n ¼ 284, and monolingual German group:n ¼ 1896), we examined if speaking another language at home
in addition to the instructional language at school presents an advantageous condition for learning
English as a foreign language. Controlling for cognitive abilities, age, gender, socio-economic status,
parental education, and indicators of cultural capital, the analysis revealed a general positive trend be-
tween bilingualism and English foreign language achievement. This positive trend differs signiﬁcantly
between bilingual groups with different home languages. The strongest predictor for foreign language
learning revealed to be proﬁciency in the instructional language.

1. Introduction
The growing proportion of immigrant students is changing the
linguistic landscape in schools. Throughout Europe, immigrant
students tend to be, on average, less successful in school than their
non-immigrant peers (Stanat & Christensen, 2006). In particular,
students with immigrant backgrounds lag behind their native peers
in reading skills in the language of instruction at school. This is true
even after controlling for socio-economic background characteris-
tics (OECD, 2010), which are factors that have been shown to play
an important role in academic achievement (Scheerens & Bosker,
1997). In Germany, the discrepancy is particularly noticeable for
ﬁrst generation immigrant students, as well as for students who
primarily speak a minority language other than German at home
(e.g. Stanat, Rauch,& Segeritz, 2010).
Despite this achievement gap, some students with immigrant
backgrounds, namely those who are functionally bilingual in the
language of instruction at school and a minority home language,
have resources that could potentially impact their foreign language
learning in positive ways. Indeed, under certain circumstances
bilingual students were shown to have an advantage when learning
an additional language (e.g.Brohy, 2001; Cenoz& Valencia, 1994;
Sanz, 2000). Bilingualism is associated with unique patterns of
cognitive and linguistic processes, which differ from those of
monolinguals and may foster foreign language learning. In fact,
bilingual students, whose languages are ofﬁcially supported by the
education system and developed through formal instruction in
school, tend to show signiﬁcant advantages in additional language
learning (Cenoz, 2003). However, it is less clear if bilingualism in
other contexts, such as bilingualism due to immigration, is associ-
ated with positive foreign language learning outcomes as well.
In the present study, we seek to determine whether there is a
relation between immigrant bilingualism and foreign language
learning outcomes and to what extent the predicted pattern holds
across bilingual groups with different instructional language pro-
ﬁciency and diverse home languages. In the following, we willﬁrst
discuss why bilinguals can be expected to have advantages in
learning additional foreign languages. Subsequently, we argue that
current research potentially masks important group differences in
language learning.

1.1. Cognitive and linguistic consequences of bilingualism
Cognitive and linguistic differences between bilinguals and
monolinguals have been studied in applied linguistics, psychology,
and education. Since the 1960s, bilingualism has been shown to be
positively related to various cognitive functions. In the landmark
study byPeal and Lambert (1962)with a matched sample, bilingual
children outperformed monolinguals in verbal and nonverbal tests
of cognitive ability. Subsequently, bilinguals have repeatedly been
shown to score higher than monolinguals on tests of various
cognitive ﬂexibility and processing functions (for reviews, see
Adesope, Lavin, Thompson,& Ungerleider, 2010; Bialystok, 2009;
Hamers & Blanc, 2000). Bialystok (2010)proposes that bilinguals
have higher levels of executive controle the interrelated processes
of inhibition, working memory, and cognitiveﬂexibility e due to
their need to switch between two language systemsﬂexibly in
varied contexts and with different interlocutors. These cognitive
consequences of bilingualism are observable in non-verbal tasks
(such as the Simon Task) that require controlled attention or the
inhibition of routine responses. In these tasks bilinguals typically
outperform monolingual controls (e.g. Bialystok, Craik, Klein, &
Viswanathan, 2004).
In addition to advantages in general cognitive functions,
bilingualism seems to be positively associated withmetalinguistic
awareness (Thomas, 1988), deﬁned as “ [ … ] the ability to focus
attention on language as an object in itself or to think abstractly
about language [… ]” (Jessner, 2006, p.42). Studies investigating
metalinguistic awareness have found that bilinguals have ad-
vantages on several metalinguistic tasks compared to mono-
linguals, such as applying morphological rules to unfamiliar
forms (e.g. Barac & Bialystok, 2012 ) or explicit noticing of
implicitly learned grammatical rules (e.g. Reder, Marec-Breton,
Gombert, & Demont, 2013). The theoretical assumption is that
bilinguals can draw upon two language systems, providing them
with a larger linguistic reservoir compared to monolinguals.
From this linguistic reservoir, which includes metalinguistic
skills, knowledge can potentially be transferred between lan-
guages and thus may be helpful when acquiring a new language
(cf. the construct ofcommon underlying proﬁciency by Cummins,
1981; 2000 ). Indeed, research has shown that metalinguistic
a w a r e n e s si sas i g n iﬁcant predictor of foreign language reading
outcomes (Dufva & Voeten, 1999; Rauch, Naumann,& Jude, 2011;
Zhang & Koda, 2013). However, this relation can be complicated
due to the relative proﬁciency level of the two languages (De
Angelis, 2007; Koda, 2007 ). Also, individual language proper-
ties, such as differences between languages with alphabetic or
logographic orthographies can play a signi ﬁcant role in the
development of metalinguistic skills (Bialystok, 1997). It has been
shown that language combinations as well as relative proﬁciency
and exposure explain noticeable variance in tasks examining
executive functions and metalinguistic awareness ( Bialystok &
Barac, 2012). For these reasons, it is useful to pay particular
attention to the speciﬁc language groups as well as language
proﬁciency to better understand the underlying mechanisms.
1.2. Factors affecting language learning
Despite the potential beneﬁts of bilingualism discussed above, it
is widely acknowledged that bilingualism does not automatically
lead to cognitive and linguistic advantages (Bialystok, 2001). The
sociocultural context in which language(s) are developed plays an
important role in a child's cognitive and linguistic development
(e.g. Vygotsky, 2012). This is especially true for such factors as
socio-economic status and cultural background, which are highly
correlated with language proﬁciency, and have the potential to
mask or even negate the positive effects of bilingualism (Cenoz &
Valencia, 1994; Jessner, 2008; Sanz, 2000). Low socio-economic
status is typically associated with lower levels of language proﬁ-
ciency for all children. In the case of immigrant bilinguals, their
lower language proﬁciency in the majority language may directly
impair the development of possible bilingual advantages (Diaz,
1983). Furthermore, as background factors can systematically
differ between immigrant groups (Müller & Stanat, 2006), it is
important not only to take them into account but also to consider
immigrant bilinguals not as a homogeneous group.
In addition to sociocultural background factors, immigrant
bilingualism differs from other forms of bilingualism because the
majority language is often fostered at the expense of the minority
home language (Cenoz, 2003), creating unknown‘levels’ of bilin-
gualism. Despite the emphasis on becoming proﬁcient in the ma-
jority language, immigrant bilinguals have been found to have
difﬁculties mastering the language of instruction in school (Esser,
2006). As international and national studies show, students who
speak another language at home tend to lag behind their mono-
lingual peers in the majority language of the community (OECD,
2010), and this gap in the language of instruction can affect their
academic performance across learning domains ( Haag, Heppt,
Stanat, Kuhl, & Pant, 2013). It may have signiﬁcant effects on
further foreign language learning as well for several reasons. Firstly,
weak majority language students might experience difﬁculties in
comprehending explicit information (i.e. grammar rules, explana-
tion of abstract vocabulary) about the foreign language, as the
teacher normally uses the majority language to transmit this
explicit information to the student. Secondly, students who are
weak in the majority language have limited resources with which
to engage linguistic transfer, i.e. the ability to learn skills in a new
language based on previously acquired language resources
(Genesee, Geva, Dressler,& Kamil, 2006).
In conclusion, bilingualism may lead to advantages in additional
language learning, yet several factors can affect this process,
especially background characteristics and language proﬁciency.
Failing to take these factors into account may be leading to biased
conclusions in empirical studies and potentially masking possible
advantages for immigrant bilingual groups.
1.3. Immigrant bilingualism and language learning: empirical
evidence
As mentioned above, a variety of factors can inﬂuence bilingual
development and consequently additional language learning,
namely background characteristics (i.e. socio-economic status,
cultural capital) as well as individual language characteristics and
proﬁciency. Studies in which both languages of the examined bi-
linguals are ofﬁcially supported by the education system through
bilingual or foreign language instruction typically show signiﬁcant
advantages of bilinguals in third language acquisition. For example,
with a sample of 17e19 year olds from the Basque Country,Cenoz
and Valencia (1994)found a signiﬁcant positive relation between
being a Basque-Spanish bilingual (compared to a Spanish mono-
lingual) and English language ability given similar levels of general
cognitive abilities, age, motivation and exposure to the foreign
language. This positive association was also replicated for English
language achievement with a sample of Catalan-Spanish bilinguals
and Spanish monolinguals (Sanz, 2000), as well as with French
achievement in a sample of Romansch-German bilingual and
Romansch monolingual children ( Brohy, 2001). These results,
replicated across several sociolinguistic contexts, suggest that
when schools support the formal development of both languages
(i.e. leading to high proﬁciency in both languages), bilingualism is
positively associated with further language learning.

Studies examining foreign language learning among immigrant
bilingual samples have yielded an unclear picture. In contrast to
students enrolled in multilingual programs, immigrant bilinguals'
home language is typically developed outside the formal school
system and supported largely through the efforts of the family. For
example, in the national population of Swedish eighth graders
(n ¼ 69.903), a heterogeneous group of immigrant bilingual stu-
dents who use only their native language at home showed no ad-
vantages compared to their Swedish monolingual classmates on a
standardized English test (M€agiste, 1984). However, students who
used both Swedish and another language at home outperformed
the Swedish monolingual students suggesting that the develop-
ment in the instructional language leads to positive transfer in third
languages. In a study examining bilingual immersion programs,
Swain, Lapkin, Rowen, and Hart (1990)found that in a Canadian
setting, speaking what they termed‘a heritage language’ at home
only had an advantage in French when the students had a certain
level of proﬁciency (i.e. literacy) in their home language. However,
neither study took into account sociocultural background factors in
the analyses.
In the Netherlands, Sanders and Meijers (1995) examined
Turkish-Dutch and Arabic-Dutch bilingualﬁfth and sixth graders.
Based on a sample matched for cognitive abilities and socio-
economic status, the authors found no differences between the
bilingual and monolingual groups in a variety of English language
skills (grammatical judgment, spontaneous language use, word
comprehension and word recognition). These ﬁndings partially
mirror the results of another Dutch study, where no signiﬁcant
differences were found between a sample of monolingual 14-year
olds and their mixed bilingual classmates with regard to English
vocabulary, grammar, and word recognition (Schoonen et al., 2002;
Van Gelderen et al., 2003). Instead, the monolinguals signiﬁcantly
outperformed their immigrant bilingual peers in two English lan-
guage measures of reading and sentence veriﬁcation as well as
Dutch reading proﬁciency, vocabulary and grammatical knowledge.
Yet, again, in none of the two aforementioned studies with samples
of immigrant bilingual students did the authors control for back-
ground characteristics of the students, such as socio-economic
status, which has been found to be a signiﬁcant factor in the
achievement gap of immigrant and non-immigrant students (e.g.
Stanat & Christensen, 2006; Walter, 2008). As group membership
and sociocultural factors may be confounded with each other, this
may obscure results.
The German English Student Assessment International(DESI) did
control for important background factors and provide strong con-
trary evidence to these previous studies. In a national representa-
tive sample of approximately 11,000 ninth graders, a
heterogeneous group of bilingual students outperformed their
monolingual peers in English listening comprehension, grammar,
reading and text writing skills (Hesse, G€obel, & Hartig, 2008). In
fact, the results of this study suggest that given similar social
background, general cognitive abilities, gender and school track,
speaking a minority language at home is positively associated with
English language learning (Klieme, 2006). Even students with an
exclusively non-German language home environment signiﬁcantly
outperformed their non-immigrant background monolingual
classmates. These ﬁndings present strong evidence that, given
comparable background characteristics as their monolingual peers,
immigrant bilinguals may have advantages in additional language
learning even if they lag behind in the language of instruction used
at school. However, because of the heterogeneity of the immigrant
bilinguals in the study, it is unclear if this is the case for all bilingual
groups.
In a reanalysis of DESI with a sample of successive bilinguals
controlling for general cognitive abilities, school track and socio-
economic status, Turkish-German, Russian-German and Polish-
German successive bilingual students had no signiﬁcant advan-
tage in their English pro ﬁciency compared to their German
monolingual peers, but a signiﬁcant positive effect was found for a
heterogeneous compound bilingual group (G€obel, Rauch,& Vieluf,
2011). Because the division between successive and compound
bilingual groups lead to small bilingual group sizes, it is unclear if
these results reﬂect a lack of differences between the successive
bilingual and monolingual groups or inadequate statistical power.
Similarly comparing Turkish-German bilinguals and German
monolinguals, Rauch, Jurecka, and Hesse (2010)found no effect of
bilingualism on English language reading achievement after con-
trolling for school track and socio-economic status. These con-
trasting results between the three DESI analyses suggest that the
effect of bilingualism may vary across groups.
In addition to the large contrast in sociocultural and linguistic
background characteristics, which might account for the varying
results in the aforementioned studies, another important factor
that can affect foreign language learning is the proﬁciency level in
the language of instruction. Most studies to date have concentrated
on the relation between bilinguals'ﬁrst and second languages. For
example, in a sample of language minority speakers, Spanish lit-
eracy skills at the entry of school resulted in higher English literacy
skills 6e8 years later (Reese, Garnier, Gallimore, & Goldenberg,
2000). To date, only a few studies have investigated the relation
between second language ability and additional foreign language
learning. In the Swiss context,Haenni Hoti et al. (2011)found that
second language competencies in English (L2) played a signiﬁcant
role in predicting both foreign language French (L3) listening and
reading comprehension. Similarly in the context of immigrant
bilingualism, German second language reading competencies was
highly correlated with proﬁciency in English as a foreign language
for Turkish-German students (Rauch et al., 2010). This suggests that
the proﬁciency in the language of instruction may be an important
factor for foreign language learning.
In sum, there is a lack of clear evidence on the relation between
immigrant bilingualism and additional language learning out-
comes, and further investigations are needed taking into account
the key factors in this process, namely the potentially confounded
effects of sociocultural background variables and language of in-
struction proﬁciency. To establish a basis for less ambiguous in-
terpretations, bilingual individuals with different instructional
language proﬁciency as well as diverse language backgrounds
should not be treated as a homogeneous group, as separation ac-
cording to proﬁciency and language combinations account for dif-
ferences with respect to linguistic properties and socio-cultural
factors between groups. Further, the consideration of confounding
variables, such as socio-economic status, is pivotal for adequate
comparisons between various groups.
1.4. Research questions
In the present study, we explore the possible beneﬁts of immi-
grant bilingualism with respect to foreign language achievement.
Speciﬁcally, the study explores the following research questions:
1. Does speaking another language at home (L1), as well as the
majority language at school (L2), provides an advantage in
learning English (L3) at school? To what extent does the ma-
jority language at school play a role in foreign language
achievement for immigrant bilingual students?
Previous research (i.e.Cenoz & Valencia, 1994; Hesse et al.,
2008) suggests that, once controlling for individual and famil-
ial background factors, the bilingual students will, on average,
have higher scores in English as a foreign language compared to
J.T. Maluch et al. / Learning and Instruction 36 (2015) 76e8578
the monolingual group. Therefore we hypothesize similar ad-
vantages for the bilingual students in the present sample (Hy-
pothesis 1a). However, as other studies have found, the expected
advantage of bilingualism depends also on the individuals'
proﬁciency in the language of instruction (i.e.Haenni Hoti et al.,
2011). Because of the strong association between bilingual stu-
dents' instructional language and foreign language achievement
(Rauch et al., 2011), we expect an advantage for bilinguals over
monolinguals if they have relatively stronger skills in the lan-
guage of instruction. Furthermore, it is theorized that bilingual
students with weaker majority language proﬁciency in contrast
do not have a sufﬁcient linguistic reservoir to support positive
transfer. Therefore, we expect that they demonstrate no ad-
vantages and will lag behind their monolingual peers as well as
their bilingual peers with strong majority language proﬁciency
(Hypothesis 1b).
2. To what extent do different bilingual language groups vary
regarding their proﬁciencies in English as a foreign language
(L3)?
Despite the general positive association between immigrant
bilingualism and foreign language learning that we expect to
ﬁnd (Hypothesis 1a), this general pattern should differ signiﬁ-
cantly between bilingual language groups. Theory suggests that
some combinations of languages may have the potential to
support foreign language learning more than others due to
analogies in linguistic properties and alphabetic scripts between
the languages (De Angelis, 2007). However, to date little is
known about speciﬁc combinations of languages and their
respective outcome compared to other combinations. As an
explorative hypothesis, we expect that given similar background
characteristics and instructional language proﬁciency groups
will generally differ with regard to their advantageous potential.
Speciﬁcally, we test the hypothesis that combinations of lan-
guages with similar orthographic scripts (i.e., Polish-German
and Turkish-German) as the dependent variable L3 will have
the highest potential compared to combinations which differ in
their scripts (i.e., Arabic-German and Chinese-German).
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
The following analyses are secondary analyses of data from the
Assessment of Reading and Mathematics Development Study
(ELEMENT), which followed a cohort of children from the fourth
grade to the sixth grade (Lehmann & Lenkeit, 2008). Data were
collected from a representative sample of students from a major
European city, whose population has about 15% of students who
speak another language than German at home ( Senate
Administration for Education, Science, & Research, 2008). This
investigation focuses on data from the sixth grade elementary
school sample. Although after the fourth grade, there is the option
of attending theGymnasium, the university-bound school track, the
majority of students (93%) attend the elementary school (Grund-
schule) until the end of the sixth grade (Lehmann & Lenkeit, 2008).
The study's sample is representative for the public elementary
school students (N ¼ 2946).
To identify bilingual groups, we analyzed the language spoken at
home as well as the frequency of the language spoken at home as
reported by the parents and students. Inclusion into one of the
language groups was determined when the parents reported that a
language other than German (the speciﬁc language was also iden-
tiﬁed) was regularly spoken in the home. If the parents' information
was missing (24%), the information provided by the student was
used. For 111 students, there was no language information from
either the parents or the students. Theﬁnal sample included in our
analysis consists ofN ¼ 2835 students nested in 134 elementary
school classes (48.5% female;Mage ¼ 12.6 years;Rage ¼ 10.7e15.3
years). From the aforementioned criterion, we identi ﬁed the
monolingual group (n ¼1896) and the bilingual group (n ¼939). We
further differentiated the bilingual students into four bilingual lan-
guage groups based on the information about the languages spoken
at home provided by the parents (Arabic-German:n ¼105, Chinese-
German: n ¼110, Polish-German:n ¼57, Turkish-German:n ¼383).
All the other bilingual groups, which were not large enough to be
analyzed separately, were combined into a composite‘other’ bilin-
gual group (languages including French, Italian, Russian, Vietnamese
and others; n ¼ 284). Given our substantive interest in patterns
across groups, we included this group in the analyses to inquire if it
shows similar trends as the other bilingual groups.
In a second approach, to analyze the role of instructional lan-
guage proﬁciency in the context of a potential bilingual advantage
in L3 learning, the bilingual group was divided intoﬁve proﬁciency
groups from a standardized competency scale. Based on the results
of the German reading test ( Baumert, Lüdtke, Trautwein, &
Brunner, 2009; Lehmann& Lenkeit, 2008), which consisted of 32
questions about four texts and scaled using one-parameter item
response theory in ConQuest (Wu Adams, & Wilson, 1998), the
bilingual group was subdivided intoﬁve groups (Bilingual German
Level 1: n ¼ 27, Bilingual German Level 2: n ¼ 120; Bilingual
German Level 3: n ¼ 273; Bilingual German Level 4: n ¼ 294;
Bilingual German Level 5:n ¼ 225).
Within the bilingual students, 41% of the parents reported that
their children were raised bilingually from birth (early bilinguals).
The rest of the bilingual children were successive in their bilingual
development. However, by the time they enteredﬁrst grade, 87% of
the parents of bilingual students reported that their children had
good German skills, which was similar to that of the monolingual
group (85%). When asked about their bilingual language practices,
bilingual children reported that they mostly spoke German with
their friends (80%) and classmates (73%). Among their parents,
grandparents and siblings, most students reported speaking at least
a little German as well as a minority language in their home
environment. Very few bilingual students reported having solely
minority language home environments (12%).
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. English language achievement
English language achievement was assessed with a Cloze test
(Lehmann & Lenkeit, 2008). The test consists of four texts with 91
word completion questions measuring reading proﬁciency, vo-
cabulary, grammar and spelling simultaneously. The items were
scaled based on one-parameter item response theory in ConQuest
(Wu et al., 1998). We used weighted likelihood estimates (WLEs) for
individual person parameters. The WLEs were scaled with a mean
parameter estimate ofM ¼ 100 and a standard deviation ofSD ¼ 20.
2.2.2. Control variables
In our analysis, we utilized the control variables of general
cognitive abilities, gender, age, socio-economic status, parental
education, and cultural capital. As general cognitive abilities might
systematically differ across groups, we used a composite score of
two subtests of the CFT4-12R: verbal andﬁgural analogies (Heller &
Perleth, 2000). This test consists of 25 picture and 20 word tasks
subtests and was administered in the fourth grade. The test-retest
reliability for this age group isr
analogies ¼ 0.83 and rﬁgural ¼ 0.93
(Heller & Perleth, 2000). Gender and age were reported in theﬁfth
and sixth grade student questionnaires.
J.T. Maluch et al. / Learning and Instruction 36 (2015) 76e85 79
Several aspects of students' social and cultural background were
assessed with the parent and student questionnaire. To measure
the family's socio-economics status, we used the International
Socio-Economic Index (ISEI; Ganzeboom & Treiman, 1996), with
the highest score of the two parents' socio-economic status (HISEI)
serving as an indicator of family socio-economic status. The highest
education of the parents was measured on aﬁve-point scale with
one indicating no qualiﬁcation andﬁve indicating a college-bound
school diploma. Finally, to operationalize cultural capital, we used
the number of books at home as a proxy variable, which was
assessed on a four-point scale with one indicating 0e25 books and
four indicating over 200 books.
2.3. Missing data and statistical analyses
As is usually the case with longitudinal large-scale data, there is
a certain number of missing values in the dataset. This primarily
stems from the lower response rate (60%) of the parents compared
to the performance instruments as well as the attrition rate be-
tween fourth and sixth grade (7%). Consequently, we conducted all
analyses usingﬁve imputed datasets, in which the missing values
were replaced by plausible values (Lehmann & Lenkeit, 2008). The
multiple imputation was based on a speciﬁed background model,
which included the individual-level factors of grades, self-concept,
interest and motivation as well as the classroom-level factors of
achievement, socio-economic status and percentage of students
with immigration background (Lehmann & Lenkeit, 2008). The
results of the analyses for theﬁve datasets were combined using
option type ¼ imputation in MPlus 5.21 ( Muth/C19en & Muth/C19en,
1998e2008). All multiple regression analyses were conducted in
MPlus 5.21 taking into account the nested nature (students in
classes) of the dataset (type¼ complex). The descriptive statistics
reported below are based on theﬁrst imputed dataset with Bon-
ferroni adjustment for all multiple comparisons.
3. Results
3.1. Descriptive statistics
To investigate the relation of bilingualism and foreign language
learning, we ﬁrst conducted descriptive analyses with the
dependent variable English language achievement and the back-
ground control variables for the monolingual and bilingual groups
(see Table 1). The dependent variable English proﬁciency varies
signiﬁcantly between the monolingual and bilingual groups
(t ¼ 7.74,p < .001, 95% CI [4.34, 7.28],d ¼ .33) with the monolingual
group having noticeably higher levels of English proﬁciency. This is
also the case for the control background characteristics of socio-
economic status ( t ¼ 19.05, p < .001, 95% CI [9.98, 12.27],
d ¼ 0.78), parental education (t ¼ 9.74, p < .001, 95% CI [0.40, 0.60],
d ¼ 0.41), and cultural capital (t ¼ 27.70,p < .001, 95% CI [1.00, 1.15],
d ¼ 1.08). Furthermore, the German monolingual group has
noticeably higher German proﬁciency than their bilingual peers
(t ¼ 17.31,p < .001, 95% CI [7.24, 9.09],d ¼ 0.69).
We next examined the individual bilingual language groups
more closely (Table 2). On the dependent variable English proﬁ-
ciency, there is signiﬁcant variation across language groups (F(5,
2829) ¼ 28.84, p < .001, hp
2 ¼ .22). The Chinese-German and Polish-
German groups performed similarly to the German monolingual
group, while the Turkish-German and Arabic-German groups per-
formed below the monolingual group.
With regard to the background variables, there are noticeable
between-group differences for the measure of HISEI, with the
monolingual group having the highest HISEI, on average, and the
Turkish-German and Arabic-German showing the lowest HISEI
mean scores (F(5, 2829) ¼ 80,42, p < .001, hp
2 ¼ .35). In a similar
vein, Turkish-German, Arabic-German as well as other bilingual
group show lower parental education than the other groups (F(5,
2929) ¼ 44,93, p < .001, hp
2 ¼ .27). Another marked difference is the
relatively low level of cultural capital (operationalized with the
reported number of books at home) of the Arabic-German group
and the Chinese-German group in comparison to all the other
groups (F(5, 2929) ¼ 151.13, p < .001, hp
2 ¼ .46). The German
monolingual group has a larger number of books at home, on
average, than all other groups.
3.2. Bilingualism and English achievement
Given our substantive interest in immigrant bilingualism and
foreign language achievement (research question 1a), weﬁtt w o
regression models testing if immigrant bilingualism is positively
associated with English foreign language achievement (Table 3). First,
we speciﬁed an uncontrolled model with the bilingual group as a
dichotomous variable compared to the monolingual reference group
(Model A). Similar to the results of the descriptive statistics, mem-
bership to the bilingual group is negatively associated English
achievement. However, this negative relation is reversed once the
background characteristics of general cognitive abilities, age, gender,
socio-economic status, parental education, and cultural capital have
been taken into account (Model B). Given comparable individual and
familiar background characteristics bilingual group membership is
positively associated with English foreign language achievement.
To investigate the effect of majority language proﬁciency in the
bilingual groups (Hypothesis 1b), we next repeated the regression

analyses with ﬁve ‘dummy’ variables for bilingual groups with
different levels of German proﬁciency compared to the mono-
lingual reference group. In Model C, weﬁt an uncontrolled model
with the bilingual groups. As shown inTable 3, there is a general
trend that for bilingual students the higher the level of German
reading is associated with increased achievement in English.
Bilingual students with weak German skills (Levels 1e3) have
weaker English language achievement than their monolingual
peers. Conversely, bilingual students with strong German skills
(Level 4e5) have higher English achievement than their mono-
lingual peers. This trend remains once background characteristics
have been taken into account (Model D) although the differences
between groups are not statistically signiﬁcant.
3.3. Patterns in English achievement across bilingual language
groups
To investigate immigrant bilingualism and English achievement
in more detail, we differentiated betweenﬁve bilingual language
groups (research question 2). We ﬁt four multiple regression
models testing if immigrant bilingual group membership is posi-
tively associated with English foreign language achievement across
the bilingual groups (seeTable 4).
Model A represents an uncontrolled model of English Language
ability with the ﬁve bilingual groups as independent ‘dummy’
variables compared to the monolingual reference group. In Model
B, we added the individual control factors of general cognitive
ability, age, and gender. In Model C, the family characteristics HISEI,
parental education and cultural capital were included in the model
as additional control factors, andﬁnally, in Model D, we controlled
for German language proﬁciency.
In Model A, we speci ﬁed an uncontrolled model with the
different language groups as independent variables. As the
descriptive statistics showed, there is signiﬁcant inter-group vari-
ation among the bilingual groups. The Polish-German group per-
forms signi ﬁcantly higher than the monolingual group. The
Chinese-German group does not display any signiﬁcant advan-
tages or disadvantages compared to the German monolingual
group. The Turkish-German and Arabic-German bilingual groups
score signiﬁcantly lower than the monolingual reference group.
Overall, the membership in the monolingual or a bilingual group
explains ﬁve percent of the variance in students' English language
achievement. However, because of the marked differences in
background variables the descriptive statistics revealed, we next
included these potentially confounding factors in the subsequent
models to hold their impact constant on the relation between
bilingual group membership and English language achievement.
In Model B, we controlled for students' age, gender and general
cognitive abilities. All three variables add substantive explanatory
power to the model (R2 ¼ 0.26). While positive effects were found
for cognitive abilities and for the female gender, there was a
negative effect of age on English language achievement, probably
resulting from students with lower proﬁciency levels repeating
grades. After controlling for these background factors, the differ-
ence in magnitude between the monolingual group and the bilin-
gual groups that had an advantage in Model A (Chinese-German
and Polish-German) increased moderately, resulting in a larger
advantages for the two bilingual groups. For the bilingual groups
who had a signiﬁcant disadvantage in Model A (Turkish-German,
Arabic-German and Other Bilingual), the disparity with the
monolingual groups diminished noticeably. Indeed, once control-
ling for general cognitive abilities, gender and age, the Turkish-
German bilingual group and the Other Bilingual group have, on
average, no longer signiﬁcant disadvantages and similar levels of
English achievement as their monolingual peers.
Next, we added family background characteristics to the model
(Model C). As expected, HISEI as well as parents' school education
play an important role, as does the cultural capital of the family.
This model explains 30% of the variation in English language ability.
Given similar socio-economic status, parental education, cultural
capital, general cognitive abilities, age and gender, three of theﬁve
bilingual groups have a signiﬁcant advantage in English language
achievement in comparison to their monolingual peers, while the
remaining bilingual groups do not differ signiﬁcantly from their
monolingual peers. The bilingual group with the largest advantage
is the Polish-German group, the Chinese-German group continues
to have a signiﬁcant advantage, and the heterogeneous bilingual
group now also shows a signiﬁcant advantage in their English
language achievement compared to their monolingual peers. There
is no longer a signiﬁcant disadvantage for the Turkish-German or
the Arabic-German group, demonstrating that once confounded
background variables are controlled, these two bilingual groups
perform similarly to their monolingual peers.
Fig. 1depicts the results for Model C, illustrating the pattern for
each group in comparison to the German monolinguals as the
reference group. Given similar individual and familial background
characteristics, the Chinese-German, Polish-German and hetero-
geneous bilingual groups show signiﬁcant advantages in their En-
glish language achievement in comparison to their monolingual
peers with a non-signiﬁcant advantage for the Turkish-German
group. The Arabic-German group, who performed signi ﬁcantly
lower than all other groups in Model A, did not perform

signiﬁcantly different from their monolingual classmates after
controlling for background variables. Despite differences between
groups, Model C shows strong evidence that, controlling for
confounded background variables, most bilinguals students, on
average, tend to have higher English languages achievement than
their monolingual counterparts in the sixth grade.
As aﬁnal step (Model D,Table 4), we included German language
proﬁciency in the regression analysis of English language
achievement remaining the background variables used in the pre-
vious regression models. Conﬁrming the importance of the in-
struction language found in theﬁrst analysis (research question 1b)
German language proﬁciency turns out to have a strong positive
relation with English language achievement with a noticeable in-
crease of explained variance (R2 ¼ 0.46). Further, entering German
reading proﬁciency into the model and therefore given comparable
German reading proﬁciency between the monolingual and bilin-
gual groups, all bilingual groups except the Arabic-German group,
have a strong signi ﬁcant advantage in their English language
achievement. The regression coefﬁcients for the Chinese-German,
Polish-German and other bilingual groups change slightly from
Model C to D. However, the coefﬁcient of the Turkish-German
group alters noticeably and now has a strong signiﬁcant advan-
tage to their monolingual counterparts. Although no signiﬁcant
advantage is detected in the Arabic-German group, whose German
skills were comparable to those of the Turkish-German group (see
Table 2), the Arabic-German group has comparable English lan-
guage achievement to that of the monolingual group.
4. Discussion
In the present study, we examined if speaking an immigrant
minority language as well as the majority language has a positive
effect on English foreign language achievement. Additionally, an-
alyses aimed at identifying the role of L2 proﬁciency in the context
of a potential bilingual advantage in L3 learning and ﬁnally,
whether the results hold true for different bilingual language
groups. All comparisons of the different groups of elementary
school students were conducted controlling for sociocultural
background factors and general cognitive abilities.
To this end, weﬁrst evaluated bilingual and monolingual stu-
dents' achievement in English as a foreign language. Because pro-
ﬁciency in the instructional language is often assumed to be an
important determinant of additional language ability (De Angelis,
2007) and in the German context there is a signiﬁcant difference
in German language outcomes between students with and without
an immigrant background (Stanat et al., 2010), we examined if and
to what extent bilingual students with different proﬁciency in the
instructional language, German, varied in their English language
achievement. Further, we compared ﬁve bilingual groups'
achievement in English as a foreign language with that of their
monolingual peers.
Regarding our ﬁrst research question the results provide evi-
dence that immigrant bilingualism can have signiﬁcant advantages
for learning English as a foreign language. The general trend sug-
gests that, given comparable background characteristics, children
who speak a minority language at home have, on average, stronger
foreign language achievement (Hypothesis 1a). These results rein-
force the theoretical assumption that speaking another language at
home supports the cognitive and metalinguistic development of
individuals, which results in enhanced foreign language learning
outcomes. However, it should be noted that while being bilingual
was found to be associated with higher English language achieve-
ment, bilingual group membership only accounted for a small
portion of the overall explained variance (R
2 ¼ .02) compared to the
background characteristics. Furthermore, the bilingual group had a
relatively slight advantage (b ¼ 2.68), which can be interpreted as
just over a quarter of a school year's achievement (Hill, Bloom,
Black, & Lipsey, 2008). Our ﬁndings parallel those revealed in the
DESI study (Hesse et al., 2008), which also found advantages for
German bilingual students. At the same time, they contrast with the
ﬁndings of earlier studies with immigrant bilinguals in the
Netherlands (Schoonen et al., 2002; Van Gelderen et al., 2003),
which found no advantages for the bilingual groups. Varying
methodologies, speciﬁcally the lack of the consideration of poten-
tially confounding background variables as well as statistical power
of the varying samples in the two Dutch studies, could explain
these inconsistent conclusions.
Although there is a general positive association, instruction
language proﬁciency plays a major role in foreign language out-
comes. In line with the hypotheses, the results of the group com-
parisons provide evidence that bilingual students with strong
instructional language skills have advantages in learning English as
a foreign language, whereas bilingual students who are weak in the
instructional language, do not perform as well as their monolingual

peers (given comparable background characteristics) (Hypothesis
1b). It should be noted that but despite a relatively large portion of
explained variance, the group differences were not signiﬁcant. This
might be due to a lack of statistical power of theﬁve subgroups.
These results replicate earlierﬁndings, which conclude that only
students that are strong in the language of instruction have beneﬁts
in learning an additional language (M€agiste, 1984).
While there was a general positive trend for the bilingual stu-
dents, this pattern varied across theﬁve bilingual groups in our
subsequent analyses (Hypothesis 2). Contrary to our hypotheses,
which focused on linguistic typology and distance between the
languages of the bilingual groups and English, the Chinese-German
students had a strong and signiﬁcant advantage in their English
achievement ( b ¼ 7.08) as did the Polish-German students
(b ¼ 7.30). Both groups' achievement was almost 0.40 of a standard
deviation, which can be translated to almost one year in achieve-
ment ahead of their monolingual peers (Hill et al., 2008). The strong
performance of the Chinese-German group is rather surprising
given the diverse linguistic properties of the two languages. In
addition, there was an advantage found for the heterogeneous
bilingual group. These results differ from those of G€obel et al.
(2011), who found no advantage for the Polish-German bilinguals.
The lack of differences for the Polish-German bilinguals in their
study might be due to the relatively small sample size of the Polish-
German group in comparison to the monolingual group.
After controlling for background factors, the Turkish-German
students had a small advantage by trend, although this difference
was not signiﬁcant from the monolingual group (b ¼ 1.90). This
replicates the ﬁndings of Sanders and Meijers (1995)as well as
Rauch et al. (2010), who found that Turkish-German bilingual
students did not signiﬁcantly differ in their English achievement
from their monolingual peers. However, as Sander and Meijers
stress, these results can be interpreted as positive given the large
lack of achievement gap between bilingual students and their
monolingual peers found in other school subjects, which is also the
case with the current sample (Lehmann & Lenkeit, 2008).
The one group who did not show any advantages was the
Arabic-German students (b ¼/C0 3.12). It is notable that while this
group initially had large disadvantages in their English achieve-
ment, the difference between Arabic-German bilingual and
monolingual students was no longer signiﬁcant after controlling for
background variables. These results replicate the ﬁndings of
Sanders and Meijers (1995), who found no signiﬁcant differences in
English achievement between Arabic-Dutch bilingual and Dutch
monolingual students. This difference in theﬁndings for the Arabic-
Germans might be due to several factors. First, as theorized in the
literature, this could be due to the language distance between the
Arabic language and English. Yet, the Chinese-German students,
whose home language has even greater language distance, did not
display this achievement gap. A more probable reason might be the
less pronounced literacy experiences of Arabic immigrant children
at home. Asbrand, Lang-Wojtasik, and K€oller (2005), for example,
explained weak Arabic literacy development with the extreme
differences between spoken and formal (written) Arabic and the
effect of a rather oral language culture of Arabic. This comparatively
weaker literacy development might affect further language
learning, both in the instructional language and in formal foreign
language learning asWagner, Spratt, and Ezzaki (1989)point out.
Finally, once German language had been entered into the model,
all bilingual groups except the Arabic-German students had a sig-
niﬁcant advantage in their English achievement. Similar to other
ﬁndings (i.e.Haenni Hoti et al., 2011; Rauch et al., 2010) and in line
with the results of ourﬁrst analysis these results show that the
language of instruction is an important factor explaining a sub-
stantial portion of the variance (
DR2 ¼ 16%). Yet, given comparable
levels of German proﬁciency between monolingual and bilinguals,
almost all bilingual groups sustain or even increase their signiﬁcant
beneﬁts in foreign language learning. This suggests that in the
context of immigrant bilingualism, the language of instruction has
speciﬁcally strong power in predicting foreign language outcomes.
As the results show, a one-point increase in German language is
associated with almost ten points on English achievement. How-
ever, as several of the bilingual groups have signiﬁcant advantages
in their English language achievement, speaking a minority home
language also support the language learning under certain
conditions.
It is interesting to note that while bilingual group membership
did add signiﬁcant explanatory power to the regression analyses, it
explains less variance than that of the background characteristics
taken together. This mirrors theﬁndings of Cenoz and Valencia
(1994) whose results, although showing signiﬁcant advantages
for bilingual students, had relatively smaller effect sizes for bilin-
gualism than other background characteristics. In the present
study, the most important predictor of foreign language outcomes
remains the language of instruction and background characteristics
with bilingualism adding a small but signiﬁcant explanation to
English achievement. Further variation could be explained through
variables assessing bilinguals' home language proﬁciency as well as
affective and motivational factors.
Taken together these results have several strong implications for
learning and instruction. Firstly, it is imperative for educators to be
aware of the unique ability and linguistic resources of bilingual
children in the foreign language classroom. Continued support for
strong instructional language skills should be a priority in formal
and informal learning environments (i.e.Stanat, Becker, Baumert,
Lüdtke, & Eckhardt, 2012). This will improve all students' foreign
language learning outcomes as well as in other subjects in school
and especially assist with bilingual students' overall linguistic
reservoir. Despite other individual and background characteristics
that might result in varying learning outcomes, bilingual students'
unique linguistic skills should be explicitly seen as a resource. As
this study highlights, much of the achievement gap in foreign
language learning between immigrant bilingual and monolinguals
stems from the systematic individual and familial differences, such
as parents' education. It should be noted that although membership
to an immigrant bilingual group is positively associated with En-
glish language ability once controlling for these background factors,
it is impossible for educators to parcel out all factors within a child.
However, it is important to understand fully from where achieve-
ment gaps stem and which resources may potentially serves in a
compensatory way. As this study successfully shows, immigrant
bilingualism is not a hindering factor, but rather it can be positively
associated with foreign language learning outcomes. This speaks to
the general beneﬁt of knowing and using two languages, even if
one of the languages is not formally supported in the education
system.
4.1. Limitations and implications for future research
Despite the largely consistentﬁndings, our study has several
limitations. One limitation is the lack of a measure of home lan-
guage proﬁciency. Group membership was based on the speciﬁ-
cation in the parental questionnaire which language was spoken
regularly in the home. Although this is a more conservative esti-
mate than the inquiring if the student has knowledge of another
language, there was no measure directly assessing the level of
proﬁciency in that language. Although a certain level of proﬁciency
can be assumed if the students speak this language regularly at
home, a measure of home language proﬁciency, and speciﬁcally
literacy skills, is likely to explain further individual variation in and
J.T. Maluch et al. / Learning and Instruction 36 (2015) 76e85 83
potentially also variation between bilingual language groups. A
measure of home language literacy would be particularly salient, as
theoretical assumptions often presupposes a certain level of pro-
ﬁciency in both languages for the cognitive and linguistic beneﬁts
of bilingualism to appear (Bialystok, 2001; De Angelis, 2007; Swain
et al., 1990). While this investigation provides an important step in
investigating different immigrant bilingual groups and their foreign
language learning, further research should address the effect of
home language proﬁciency, the language of instruction and that of
third language learning in school for immigrant bilinguals.
Another important avenue for further research should focus on
the mechanisms, namely metalinguistic awareness, that are ex-
pected to mediate the language learning process directly. This
large-scale study provides evidence that speaking a minority lan-
guage e even one that is not explicitly taught in the education
system - can provide a student with unique skills and abilities,
which are especially salient for education in the foreign language
classroom. With further research into these mechanisms and their
effect on language learning, educators can better tap into the
abilities of their students, and curricula can more accurately reﬂect
needs of not only monolingual but the increasing population of bi-
and multilingual children present in the classroom. As educational
systems around the world are increasing tackling the changing
demographics in the classroom, the importance of identifying not
only potential weakness, but strengths, is increasingly important
for successful learning. As immigrant bilingual students are often
labeled as facing dif ﬁcult challenges, it is also important to
remember that those challenges are coupled with beneﬁts, which
in some areas of learning, can further their academic success.

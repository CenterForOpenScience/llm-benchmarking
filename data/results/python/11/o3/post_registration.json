      "description": "The authors conducted secondary analyses of the ELEMENT cohort to examine whether speaking a minority home language is associated with better English-as-a-foreign-language achievement. They scaled language tests using item-response theory, created imputed datasets for missing values, and ran multiple regression models (with complex, clustered design) to test associations while controlling for numerous background variables.",

      "summary": "After controlling for cognitive, demographic and socio-economic background factors, bilingualism was positively associated with English achievement. The strength of this association varied by instructional-language proficiency and by specific bilingual group. Chinese-German and Polish-German students showed the largest advantages (~7 WLE points). Turkish-German and a heterogeneous bilingual group also showed positive trends once German proficiency was controlled. Arabic-German students performed similarly to monolingual peers after adjustment. Overall, German reading proficiency was the strongest single predictor of English achievement.",

  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The summary provides a detailed narrative of the replication process and outcomes, but it does not fully align with the reference document's requirement for a binary decision on claim replication. The summary mentions a reversal in the coefficient sign, which is a significant finding, but it lacks the explicit binary statement of whether the claim was replicated."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The execution status is clearly stated as 'Success,' which aligns with the reference document's requirement for a clear status report."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The method alignment is mostly similar to the reference. It describes the execution process and minor deviations, but it does not mention the specific differences in the English ability measurement and the absence of cognitive ability control, which are significant deviations noted in the reference."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].issue_description": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The issue description matches the reference document's description of the differences in the sample and operationalization of the bilingual variable."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact is mostly similar to the reference, acknowledging the influence of population and operationalization changes, but it does not explicitly mention the potential impact of the different English ability measurement."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The issue description is mostly similar, noting the treatment of the cultural-capital variable, but it does not mention the absence of cognitive ability control, which is a significant deviation in the reference."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact is mostly similar, acknowledging the low likelihood of affecting the focal coefficient, but it does not consider the potential impact of missing cognitive ability control."
  },
  "results_comparison.hypothesis_tested": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis tested is an exact match with the reference document, restating the focal hypothesis accurately."
  },
  "results_comparison.original_results": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The original results are an exact match with the reference document, including the coefficient, significance level, and context."
  },
  "results_comparison.replication_results": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The replication results are loosely related. The reported negative coefficient contradicts the reference document's positive replication outcome, indicating a significant difference in findings."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The overall answer is loosely related. The JSON states the replication did not satisfy the preregistered criteria, while the reference document indicates a successful replication, showing a significant discrepancy."
  },
  "replication_report": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The replication report is loosely related. It states the replication was unsuccessful, contradicting the reference document's conclusion of a successful replication."
  },
  "failure_handling[0].failure_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The failure type 'Code/Execution Failures' is an exact match with the reference document's context of handling code issues."
  },
  "failure_handling[0].suggestions": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The suggestions are mostly similar, providing actionable recommendations for code issues, but they do not address the broader methodological differences noted in the reference."
  },
  "failure_handling[1].failure_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The failure type 'Method/Alignment Failures' is an exact match with the reference document's context of handling methodological differences."
  },
  "failure_handling[1].suggestions": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The suggestions are mostly similar, recommending analysis adjustments, but they do not fully address the specific deviations in English ability measurement and cognitive ability control noted in the reference."
  },
  "notes": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The notes are mostly similar, acknowledging contextual moderators and suggesting further analyses, but they do not fully align with the reference document's detailed discussion of the replication's limitations and differences."

Existing Data Replication 
Study Information 
1. Title (provided by SCORE) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This has been determined by SCORE. 
 
Replication of a research claim from Maluch et al. (2015) in Learning and Instruction.

3. Description of study (provided by SCORE) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This description has been provided by SCORE. Please review and 
make a SCORE project coordinator aware of any edits, additions, and corrections you would 
suggest to the paragraph. You are free to add additional descriptions of your project in a 
separate paragraph.  
 
The claim selected for replication from Maluch et al. (2015) is as follows: The general trend 
suggests that, given comparable background characteristics, children who speak a minority 
language at home have, on average, stronger foreign language achievement (Hypothesis 1a). 
This reflects the following statement from the paper's abstract: "Controlling for cognitive abilities, 
age, gender, socio-economic status, parental education, and indicators of cultural capital, the 
analysis revealed a general positive trend between bilingualism and English foreign language 
achievement." Given the authors’ substantive interest in immigrant bilingualism and foreign 
language achievement (research question 1a), they fit two regression models testing if 
immigrant bilingualism is positively associated with English foreign language achievement 

 
(Table 3). Model B is selected, and the focal variable is ‘Bilingual (=1)’ (see Model B in Table 3 
for details). ...However, this negative relation is reversed once the background characteristics of 
general cognitive abilities, age, gender, socio-economic status, parental education, and cultural 
capital have been taken into account (Model B). Given comparable individual and familiar 
background characteristics bilingual group membership is positively associated with English 
foreign language achievement (from Model B in Table 3, ‘Bilingual (=1)’ variable: estimate = 
2.68; p < .01). 
 
4. Hypotheses (provided by SCORE with possible Data Analyst additions) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: The focal test for SCORE is indicated as H*. If you will test 
additional hypotheses (or use alternate analyses) that help you to evaluate the claim your 
replication/reproduction is testing, number them H1, H2, H3 etc. (You can place H* in the list 
wherever makes sense). Please make sure that any additional hypotheses are logical 
deductions/operationalizations of the selected SCORE claim or are necessary to properly 
interpret the focal H* hypothesis.  Research that is outside this scope should be described in a 
separate preregistration. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Are the listed hypotheses specific, concise, clearly testable, and specified at the level of 
operationalized variables?  
● Are hypotheses identified as directional or non-directional, and, if applicable, have the 
direction of hypotheses been stated? (Example: “Customers’ mean choice satisfaction 
will be higher in the CvSS architecture condition than in the standard attribute-by- 
attribute architecture condition.”) 
● Does the list of hypotheses/tests indicate whether additional hypotheses are taken from 
the original study or modified/added by the team? 
 
H*: Bilingual group membership will be positively associated with foreign language achievement 
when controlling for background variables. 
 
 
 
 

 
Design Plan 
5. Study type 
NOTE: The study type selected should be based on the data collected for the replication, and 
not necessarily the data used in the original study. 
 
● Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes 
field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes 
randomized controlled trials. 
● Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly 
assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, natural experiments, and 
regression discontinuity designs. 
● Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies. 
● Other  
6. Blinding 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Select any/all of the below that apply for your study by bolding 
them. You will give a longer description in the next question. 
 
● No blinding is involved in this study. 
● For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which 
they have been assigned. 
● Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human 
subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments. (Commonly known as “double 
blind”) 
● Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the treatment 
applied to any given group. 
 
[QUESTION 6 - BOLD YOUR RESPONSE ABOVE] 
 
7. Blinding 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Since all existing data replications are based on data that has 
already been collected, in most cases it will not be necessary to comment on participant 
blinding. In the rare instance when an existing experiment is being re-analyzed for an existing 
data replication and blinding is a relevant consideration, please provide below any details 
regarding blinding that are important for a reviewer to be aware of. 
 
No blinding is involved in this study to the data finder’s knowledge.  
 
 

 
8. Study Design 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Please describe how data was collected in the original study and 
how it compares to the data that was selected for the replication attempt. Explain why the data 
selected for the replication study is suitable for a replication and if any substantial deviations 
exist between the two. 
 
If the data used in the replication combines observations from the original study with new 
observations (e.g. if the data selected for the replication attempt comes from the same 
longitudinal survey as the original study), describe how ‘original’ and ‘new’ observations relate to 
each other and an estimate for what proportion of the final dataset’s observations will be 
comprised of original vs. new observations. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration specify the unit of analysis? 
● Does the preregistration provide sufficient detail about how the data selected for the 
replication attempt deviates from or is congruent with the data employed in the original 
study? 
● Does the preregistration describe whether and how ‘original’ and ‘new observations’ are 
combined together for the replication dataset? 
 
The analyses of the original paper are secondary analyses of data from the Assessment of 
Reading and Mathematics Development Study (ELEMENT), which followed a cohort of children 
from the fourth grade to the sixth grade (ISCED2). The longitudinal study ELEMENT pursues 
the aim of examining the learning situation and progress of pupils in the transition area between 
primary and secondary level at primary schools in Berlin and undergraduate high schools. A 
design with three measuring times from fourth to sixth grade was realized. The pupils' 
performance in the areas of German and mathematics were the focus of the surveys. At the 
third time of measurement, they were supplemented by a performance measure in the area 
“English as a foreign language”. The parents also received a questionnaire to determine the 
family living conditions of the children and their own educational attitudes. The original study 
focused on data from the sixth grade elementary school sample (third measurement point). The 
study's sample is representative for the public elementary school students (N = 2946), whose 
mean age is 14.97 (sd = 0.92), ranging from 11 to 23 years old.  
 
The original study uses this dataset to investigate the effect of immigrant bilingualism on 
learning English as a foreign language. The SCORE focal claim is concerned with hypothesis 
1a: “Given comparable background characteristics, children who speak a minority language at 
home have, on average, stronger foreign language achievement”. The results of this hypothesis 
can be found in Table 3, Model b. The dependent variable is “English foreign language 
achievement”, the focal independent variable is “Bilingualism” and the control variables are 
general cognitive abilities, age, gender, SES, parental education, cultural capital.  
 

 
The proposed replication dataset is the European Survey on Language Competences (ESLC) 
from 2012. It is designed to collect information about the foreign language proficiency of 
students in the last year of lower secondary education (ISCED2) or the second year of upper 
secondary education (ISCED3)  in 14 participating countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, 
England, Estonia, France, Greece, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, 
Sweden). The ESLC is a collaborative effort among the 16 participating educational systems1 
and the company SurveyLang partners to measure the language proficiency of approximately 
53,000 students across Europe, to assist the European Commission in establishing a European 
Indicator of Language Competence to monitor progress against the March 2002 Barcelona 
European Council conclusions. These conclusions called for ‘action to improve the mastery of 
basic skills, in particular by teaching at least two foreign languages from a very early age’ and 
also for the ‘establishment of a linguistic competence indicator’.  
 
Each educational system tested students in two languages; the two most widely taught of the 
five most widely taught European languages: English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. 
This effectively meant that there were two separate samples within each educational system, 
one for the first test language, and one for the second. Each sampled student was tested in one 
language only. Students’ proficiency was assessed in two of the three skills of Listening, 
Reading and Writing. The ESLC sets out to assess students’ ability to use language 
purposefully, in order to understand spoken or written texts, or to express themselves in writing. 
Their observed language proficiency is described in terms of the levels of the Common 
European Framework of Reference (CEFR) (Council of Europe 2001), to enable comparison 
across participating educational systems. Next to students’ test and ability (Plausible Values) 
scores in Listening, Reading and Writing, the ESLC also contains Student-, Teacher- and 
Principal Questionnaire on contextual information. 
 
For the potential replication dataset it is proposed to only use students who correspond to 
ISCED2. The reason for this is that in many educational systems this applies to the average age 
range of about 12 to 15 years, which is very close to the test assessment year of the original 
study (6th grade in Germany ~ 12 years old). In the ESLC, students who correspond to ISCED2 
can differ in age between educational systems, however they all have in common the number of 
schooling years learning English as a foreign language. A potential age effect would be however 
noticed as the analysis model introduces age as a control variable. The subsample of the ESLC 
ISCED2 students entails 20,026 students. 
 
While the original study used the Cloze test (consisting of four texts with 91 word completion 
questions measuring reading proficiency, vocabulary, grammar and spelling simultaneously) the 
proposed replication dataset includes measurements of students' listening, reading and writing 
abilities. Therefore, the dependent variable “English as a foreign language-ability” divided into 
reading, writing and listening abilities in the proposed replication dataset would be more refined. 
The proposed replication dataset contains all necessary variables needed for replication 
 
1 Belgium entails three different country communities with respective differing educational systems. 
Therefore, the number of countries in the overall ESLC sample does not equal the number of educational 
systems. 

 
besides one control variable “general cognitive abilities” which will be further explained in 
section 12c. Furthermore, the average age of the students might slightly differ, however this is 
considered marginal as the findings/interpretations of the original study are not limited to this 
age group. 
 
9. Randomization (free response) 
 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: If the variables used for this replication attempt were randomized, 
state how they were randomized, and at what level. 
 
No randomization was executed after the stage of the official data collection by ESLC, 
especially not by the data finder. 
 
However, ESLC is a representative student assessment framework which underlies general 
sampling theoretical cornerstones in conducting their data collection process, such as which 
schools and which students within schools are tested. Furthermore, students have been tested 
in two of the three English ability skills (reading, writing, listening). Individual students have 
administered tests concerning either Reading and Listening, Reading and Writing, or Listening 
and Writing. Students have been assigned randomly to one of these three groups. To the data 
finder’s best knowledge this procedure is not done for experiments but for efficiency reasons 
and representative results. 
 
For further information: ESLC Technical report, particularly p. 29 (student English ability), p. 106 
and p. 126 (Simple random sampling).

Sampling Plan 
 
This section describes how the data sources for the replication were selected, how they were 
prepared into a replication dataset, and the number of observations that will be analyzed from 
these data. Please keep in mind that the data described in this section are the actual data used 
for analysis, so if you are using a subset of a larger dataset, please describe the subset that will 
actually be used in your study. 
10. Existing data (multiple choice question, provided by SCORE) 
1.1.1. 
Registration prior to creation of data 
1.1.2. 
Registration prior to any human observation of the data 
1.1.3. 
Registration prior to accessing the data 
1.1.4. 
Registration prior to analysis of the data 
1.1.5. 
Registration following analysis of the data 

 
 
11. Explanation of existing data 
NOTE: For replications that rely on existing data sources, this question refers to the data that 
will be used for the replication analysis (i.e. the final replication dataset), and not (a) the data 
from the original study or (b) the data sources accessed to construct the replication dataset. 
Since no new data will be created for ‘existing data replications,’ 1.1.1 should never be selected. 
Since all analyses will occur after registration, 1.1.5 should also never be selected. 
 
The final dataset for replication has been accessed, and cleaned to a very low degree prior to 
registration. This means that the relevant students (ISCED2) were filtered and necessary 
variables were selected. Observations with NA values were preserved. The European Survey 
on Language Competences (ESLC) from 2012 has been chosen for replication. The final 
dataset includes all variables to conduct the main analysis. The main analysis for replication is a 
multi-level model considering the individual, the school and country level2. The selected 
variables in the final dataset represent the same constructs (besides the possibly differing 
levels)  than the variables used in the original study. One variable from the original study, 
General cognitive abilities, is not available in the ESLC.  
12. Data collection procedures 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Please describe the process for constructing the replication 
dataset in as much detail as you can. The sections below should be used to provide the 
following information: 
● Which variables are needed from the original study to perform a good-faith, high-quality 
replication.  
● Which data sources were used, why they were selected, any deviations between the 
original study design and the replication study design that these selections present, and 
the procedures used to access the data. 
● Which of the variables from the original study are available in the replication data 
sources, including relevant details about each measure. 
● The procedure for creating the replication dataset, in both narrative and script form. 
● A data dictionary that documents each variable included in the replication dataset. 
 
In the sections below, please provide links to the original materials whenever possible -- 
including descriptions of the original datasets and corresponding codebooks. If materials can be 
shared on the OSF, please do so, and provide view-only links to those materials. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind for reviewers: 
 
2 If multiple countries are chosen for final replication analysis (as suggested by the data finder to increase 
power) the country level needs to be implemented into the regression model. As the original study only 
collected data from Germany, a country level was not necessary. 

 
● Does the preregistration describe which data sources were selected for the replication 
study and why each is suitable? 
● Does the preregistration make clear how the data sources were used to construct the 
replication dataset? 
(a) Data Needed 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: List below the datasets and variables the original author used to 
analyze the focal claim. Include details regarding the sample size, waves or years used, and 
other details pertinent to finding an existing dataset for replication. Please include page 
numbers when excerpting from the original article. If possible, categorize the list of variables as 
one of the following: dependent variable, focal independent variable, control variable, or sample 
parameters/clustering variable. Finally, include the sample size of the original study’s focal 
analysis, if it is available. 
 
As explained above, the original study utilized the ELEMENT data and focused on the sixth 
grade elementary school sample. While the authors clearly state which constructs they include 
in the analysis, the identification of concrete measurements is often not quite transparent. 
 
Dependent Variable(s) 
English ability  
● Variable Data Source: ELEMENT, 2003-2005 
● Assessed with a Cloze test (a procedure in which a subject is asked to supply words that 
have been removed from a passage as a test of their ability to comprehend text). 
● The test consists of four texts with 91 word completion questions measuring reading 
proficiency, vocabulary, grammar and spelling simultaneously.  
● The items were scaled based on one-parameter item response theory in ConQuest (Wu 
et al.,1998). Weighted likelihood estimates (WLEs) for individual person parameters 
were used. The WLEs were scaled with a mean parameter estimate of M = 100 and a 
standard deviation of SD = 20. 
 
 
Focal Independent Variable(s) 
Bilingualism 
● Variable Data Source: ELEMENT, 2003-2005 
● Variable in original study (focal claim): Being bilingual or not (dummy) 
● Measured how: Number and frequency of languages spoken at home (parents and/or 
student questionnaire).  
● Operationalized: It can be derived if a foreign language was spoken regularly at home 
and if so then a student is classified as bilingual 
 
Control Variable(s) 
General Cognitive Abilities 
● Variable Data Source: ELEMENT, 2003-2005

(b) Data Access 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:  Describe below the data sources that will provide the replication 
variables. Include information such as the name of the data source (e.g., Indonesian Family Life 
Survey), the description and link of the data source, and the waves needed to create a final 
replication dataset.  
 
Also describe the process for accessing the data sources that will be used to create the final 
replication dataset; specify how long long it took for the registration to be approved and what 
information was required (e.g., writeup of the purpose of the project, email address from an 
IPCSR institution, etc.); and verify that the data can be opened as expected. If applicable, 
provide a link to the page where you registered to access the data. 
 
Describe in detail any restrictions on data access and data-sharing, as well as any additional 
terms of data use that will be relevant for the replication study and final report (e.g. citations that 
will need to be made). If you were able to access the data because of special permissions that 
you have, but that you expect other researchers might not have, please document those as well. 
 
Data access is granted by the Joint Research centre of the EU Commission and is limited to 
people who have registered this access at the JRC. Momentarily (21.08.2020), only the data 
finder (Marco Ramljak) and the data analyst have access to the raw data files. If further people 
need access this needs to be worked out via the data finder who will notify the JRC.  The data 
can be freely used for research purposes related to the SCORE project.  
 
It should be cited in the following way: 
Costa, P., & Albergaria-Almeida, P. (2015). The European survey on language competences: 
Measuring foreign language student proficiency. Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 191, 
2369-2373. 
 
(c) Variable Availability 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: For each variable required for the replication analysis (listed 
above), describe the variables from the replication data that can be used to measure it 
(including which data files or sources each measure is found in), any notes a data analyst 
should consider when using the measure in a replication analysis, and any important 
differences between the original variable and the proposed replication variable. 
 
If there are multiple variables in the replication data that correspond to a required variable (e.g. 
two different measures of education in the replication data), include all of those options below. If 
a variable from the original study cannot be measured using the replication data, please make 
that clear as well. Finally, include a description of the identifiers used to merge multiple 
datasets, if applicable. 
 

 
All variables which are needed for the replication of the focal claim can be found in the ESLC 
besides one control variable: score for general cognitive ability.3 This is a limitation that needs to 
be addressed in the replication. Furthermore, data analysis should include a further cluster 
variable next to the School ID, for the multilevel analysis, namely the Country ID of the 
respective student. 
 
Dependent Variable(s) 
English ability  
● Variable Data Source: ESCL, 2012 
● Plausible values for the students’ performance scores in Listening, Reading and Writing 
(Randomly assigned, students administered up to two out of the three skills mentioned). 
Plausible values for two English ability skills per student will be provided. 
○ Acronym (e.g. for writing): PV1_WRIT_C - PV5_WRIT_C 
● Alternative: Plausible level of students English ability skills in Listening, Reading and 
Writing. The Language test measures achievement of levels A1 to B2 of the Common 
European Framework of Reference (CEFR). The pre-A1 level which is also reported 
indicates failure to achieve A1 (Technical report, p. 5).  
○ Acronym (e.g. for writing): PL1_WRIT_C - PL5_WRIT_C 
● Further note: The data analyst has to decide if it is preferred to use plausible values or 
plausible levels for analysis. It is suggested by the data finder to use plausible values, as 
these are on a larger interval scale while plausible levels rely on a 5 point ordinal scale. 
This means that plausible values contain larger variation across the students. 
● Difference to original study: While the original study used the Cloze test (consisting of 
four texts with 91 word completion questions measuring reading proficiency, vocabulary, 
grammar and spelling simultaneously) the proposed replication dataset includes 
measurements of students listening, reading and writing abilities.  
 
 
Focal Independent variable  
 
3 General cognitive ability (GCA) is very often controlled for in similar studies as these studies 
assume a relation between having high GCA and high abilities in school subjects such as 
languages. When replicating this study without GCA I believe that the regression coefficient of 
the focal independent variable will be higher and the Adj.R² will be lower as in the original study. 
These assumptions stem from comparing Model A and Model B (focal model) in the original 
study (Table 3) - the effect size of the focal independent variable is larger in Model A then in 
Model B, the adj.R² is lower in Model A than in Model B. Unfortunately, no standard errors nor 
more granular models are reported, for example a model with only the focal independent 
variable and GCA implemented, to compare the unstandardized effect sizes with their 
respective coefficients in other models. This limitation needs to be addressed in a potential 
replication as the implementation of the background variables as whole into the regression 
equation are responsible for the positive sign of the focal independent variable regression 
coefficient. To the data finders' knowledge, no statistically profound assumption can be made -  
based on the available information reported in the original study - if controlling for GCA is solely 
responsible for the positive sign of the focal independent variable’s coefficient. 
 

 
Bilingualism 
● Variable Data Source: ESCL, 2012 
● Predefined compound index: Number of languages used at home 
● Acronym: I03_ST_A_S26A 
○ Measured how: The index equals the number of selected options in question 
SQ26 'Which language(s) do you, yourself, speak regularly at home?’.  
○ Units: The index has the following categories: 1=”One language” (sum score=1); 
2=”Two languages” (sum score=2); 3=”Three or more languages” (sum score≥3). 
○ Proposed operationalization: Everyone who has more than one language 
indicated in the index will be categorized as bilingual (with a label = 1) and the 
others as monolingual (with a label = 0) 
● In addition: Predefined index: Target language use at home 
○ Acronym: I03_ST_A_S27B 
○ Units: 0 = No; 1= Yes 
○ Proposed operationalization: With this variable it can be determined if students 
speak English regularly at home. It is up to the data analyst if these should be 
filtered out for analysis. 
○ Further note: It is not clear if students speaking English at home have been 
excluded from the analysis conducted in the original study.  
 
Control variables 
Age  
● Variable Data Source: ESCL, 2012 
● Predefined compound index: Age 
● The index equals the difference between the date of the middle of the testing window in 
each Educational system and the date of birth SQ2 ‘What is your date of birth?’. 
● Acronym: I08_ST_A_S02A  
 
Gender 
● Variable Data Source: ESCL, 2012 
● Variable: Gender 
● Acronym: SQt01i01 
● Units: Female (0), Male (1)  
 
Socio-economic status (HISEI) 
● Variable Data Source: ESCL, 2012 
● Predefined index: Parental occupation 
● Acronym: HISEI 
● The students’ answers to the four questions about parental occupation were coded in 
each educational system using the International Standard Classification of Occupations 
(ISCO-88) developed by ILO, including the PISA modifications:  

 
● SQ7 'What is your mother’s main job?' 
● SQ8 'What does your mother do in her main job?’ 
● SQ10 'What is your father’s main job?’ 
● SQ11 'What does your father do in his main job?’ 
● The codes for parental occupation (ISCO_M “International Standard Classification of 
Occupation mother” and ISCO_F “International Standard Classification of Occupation 
father”) were transformed into the international socio-economic index of occupational 
status (ISEI) (Ganzeboom & Treiman 1996). The higher ISEI scores indicated higher 
levels of occupational status. The component “parental occupation (HISEI)” corresponds 
to the higher ISEI score of either parent or the only available parent’s ISEI. For further 
information see technical report, p. 246.  
 
Parental education 
● Variable Data Source: ESCL, 2012 
● Predefined index: Highest parental education expressed in years 
● Acronym: PARED 
● The calculation of this component is based on a transformation of the answers to 
two questions: 
● SQ13 'What is the highest level of schooling completed by your mother?' 
● SQ14 'What is the highest level of schooling completed by your father?’ 
● The responses to these questions were converted into estimated years of 
schooling using the mapping of PISA 2006 (OECD 2007) with a few small 
changes, because not all educational systems participating in the ESLC were 
represented in the PISA table. The component “higher parental education 
expressed as years of schooling” (PARED) corresponds to the higher PARED 
score of either parent or the only available parent’s PARED. See technical report, 
p. 246.  
 
Cultural capital 
● Variable Data Source: ESCL, 2012 
● VariableHome possessions  
● Acronym: SQt21i01 
● Question: How many books are there in your home? 
● Units: 0-10 books (0), 11-25 books (1), 26-100 books (2), 101-200 books (3), 201-500 
books (4), More than 500 books (5).

(d) Data Creation 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Create a dataset using the data sources and variables listed 
above. Provide a detailed narrative describing how the various datasets were cleaned and 
merged into a final replication dataset. Provide a view-only link to a clearly commented script on 
the OSF that produces the replication data as described in the narrative. Our preference is that 
this be either an R script or a script from another language that similarly allows for open and 
reproducible analyses. Please let the SCORE team know if this is not possible. 
● If the data can be freely shared and posted to OSF, please post it in your OSF project 
and provide a link to the completed dataset below. 

 
● If any part of the dataset cannot be shared between researchers or posted to the OSF, 
please leave the final dataset off the OSF. Instead, include either below or in your script 
(commented out at the bottom) two pieces of information that will help an independent 
team verify they have created the dataset according to your instructions: 
○ The dimensions of the final dataset(s) you’ve created (# of rows, # of columns) 
○ A summary of 8-10 variables in the replication dataset. For numeric variables, the 
summary should include the mean, standard deviation, and count of NAs. For 
categorical variables, the summary should include each level present in the data 
and its count, as well as a count of NAs. If multiple datasets are submitted as 
part of your work, at least one variable should be included from each dataset. 
 
The data from the replication sources should be preserved in as ‘raw’ a form as possible, in 
order to give the data analyst the most latitude to clean the variables as they see fit. Variables 
from the original source should be preserved in their original form (e.g. do not recode values of 
99 to NA). New variables should only be created when they’re needed to complete the merge or 
combine the datasets; in those cases, please preserve a version of the original, unaltered 
variable in the new dataset.  
 
Please also use this section to describe: 
● Any deviations between the original study design and the replication design that would 
result from using this replication dataset. 
● Any notes about using these variables that you would like to pass along to the data 
analyst. 
 
The attached uncompiled R-notebook script is very detailed in its sections and can be found 
here: https://osf.io/y742m/  
 
The most important issue for the data analyst concerns the dependent variable. In the 
replication dataset I included the plausible values for student’s English ability skills in reading, 
writing and listening, as well as the plausible level for student’s English ability skills in reading, 
writing and listening. The data analyst has to decide which set of variables to use for the 
analysis. Another issue related to the dependent variable is that each student was only tested in 
two of the English ability skills (see explanation in the randomization section). Consequently, 
each student has only plausible values for two of the three English ability skills (Reading and 
Listening, Reading and Writing, or Listening and Writing). No overall value for a student's 
English abilities in reading, writing and listening is available in the dataset. General information 
on how to handle plausible values can be found in the Technical report in Chapter 12.  
 
Additionally, relevant student weights needed for analysis are included in the replication dataset. 
General information on how to handle these weights can be found in the Technical report in 
Chapter 13.7.  
 
Link to the report: https://osf.io/c6y8r/  
 

 
Lastly, concerning the focal  independent variable bilingualism: The replication dataset includes 
a variable on the “Number of languages used at home”. For the suggested operationalization of 
this variable see Variable Availability. I, the data finder, suggest controlling for the fact if a 
student uses the target language (English) at home. This information can be found in the 
variable “Target language use at home”.  
(e) Data Dictionary 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Create a data dictionary following this template. Provide below a 
view-only link to the completed data dictionary included in the OSF project. If the Data Analyst 
will need to create new variables using the variables in the final replication dataset (e.g. 
recoding the provided education variable to be in a better format for analysis), please document 
below your recommendation on how the analyst should do so. Please also document any 
additional notes regarding the variables in the dataset that do not fit within the provided data 
dictionary template or the other sections above. 
 
The data dictionary can be found here: https://osf.io/ym5ac/ 
 
The codebook can be found here: https://osf.io/j4gu7/ 
 
The technical report can be found here:: https://osf.io/c6y8r/  
13. Sample size 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Please report below the analytic sample size(s) in the replication 
dataset, with reference to however many units or levels are in the data. Please report as much 
information here as will be helpful for the review committee to be aware of, including differences 
in sample size resulting from various analytic decisions (e.g. listwise deletion vs multiple 
imputation). Finally, when the replication combines observations from the original study 
with new observations, please estimate what proportion of the analytic sample’s 
observations will be comprised of original vs. new observations. 
 
Data finders’ response goes here: 
 
For the potential replication dataset it is proposed to only use students who correspond to 
ISCED2 and who have participated in an English test. For most of the different educational 
systems this applies to the average age range of about 12 to 15 years. The subsample of the 
ESLC ISCED2 students entails 20,026 students, nested in 901 schools in 11 countries. When 
excluding students with NAs for relevant variables as explained above, only the number of 
students is reduced, not the number of schools nor the countries. 
 
As explained above, students have been tested in two of the three English ability skills (reading, 
writing, listening). Individual students have received Reading and Listening, Reading and 
Writing, or Listening and Writing. Consequently, students only have plausible values/levels for 
the respective two English ability skills.  

 
 
When only focusing on the English ability skill writing (as a dependent variable), the final 
replication dataset contains 13,006 observations. After listwise deletion of relevant variables 
(exclusion of variables related to reading and listening), the final replication dataset includes 
10,291 observations.  
 
When only focusing on the English ability skill listening (as a dependent variable), the final 
replication dataset contains 13,245 observations. After listwise deletion of relevant variables 
(exclusion of variables related to reading and writing), the final replication dataset includes 
10,420 observations.  
 
When only focusing on the English ability skill reading (as a dependent variable), the final 
replication dataset contains 13,376 observations. After listwise deletion of relevant variables 
(exclusion of variables related to listening and writing), the final replication dataset includes 
10,482 observations.  
 
The following table presents country specific sample sizes for each English ability skill (writing, 
listening, reading) with listwise deletion applied:

Required sample size [to be filled out by the SCORE team]: The primary unit of analysis is the 
student. An estimate of the minimum viable sample size for the data analytic replication is: 

 
1643. For comparison, the stage1 required sample size would be: 5970 and the stage2 sample 
size would be: 8950. 
 
14. Sample size rationale 
 
For data analytic replications in SCORE, three sample sizes are calculated: 
● A minimum threshold sample size, defined as the sample size required for 50% power of 
100% of the original effect 
● A stage 1 sample size, defined as the sample size needed to have 90% power to detect 
75% of the original effect 
● A stage 2 sample size, defined as the sample size needed to have 90% power to detect 
50% of the original effect 
Details about how those sample sizes were calculated for this project are found here: 
https://osf.io/yhp8r/?view_only=ce7c2737afbe458aaf8d9a05e78f7d61 
15. Stopping rule (provided by SCORE) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:  
 
Since the replication data does not include any observations from the original analysis, SCORE 
recommends that only a single analysis using all available observations be performed for the 
replication. 
 
Variables 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: The preregistration form divides variables across three questions: 
manipulated variables, measured variables, and indices (i.e. analytic variables derived from raw 
variables). For existing data replications, only fill out the “Measured variables’ and ‘Indices’ 
sections. Please do not fill out anything in the ‘Manipulated variables’ section.  
 
The raw data of any transformed variable (e.g. reaction time → log reaction time) or any created 
index should be defined in the ‘Measured variables’ section. Details regarding the variable 
transformation should be specified in the ‘Transformations’ section. Details regarding the 
creation of an index should be specified in the ‘Indices’ section.  
 
Across these questions, you should define all variables that will later be used during your 
analysis (including data preparation/processing). You can describe all variables in the 
preregistration and/or summarize and link to a data dictionary (codebook) in your repository to 
answer these questions. 
 

 
If you will share data from your replication, this is also the place to state whether any variables 
will be removed prior to sharing the dataset (e.g. to reduce risk of participant identification or 
comply with copyright restrictions on scale items.)   
 
16. Manipulated variables 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Manipulated variables in this preregistration refer specifically to 
variables that have been randomly assigned in an experiment. The use of data from an 
experiment should be rare in existing data replications. If your existing data replication relies on 
experimental data, please document each manipulated variable as a measured variable, and 
use the codebook to indicate what each level of the variable corresponds to (e.g. participants 
assigned to the treatment condition = 1; participants assigned to the control condition = 0). The 
default language in bold below has been copied into all existing data replication preregistrations.  
 
N/A -- not documented for existing data replications. 
 
There have been no manipulated variables in this project. All variables were measured.  
17. Measured variables 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Please use this section to document each variable that was used 
in the original study’s analysis and the role it served (e.g. dependent variable, control variable, 
sample parameter, etc). For each variable, provide the description of the variable offered in the 
paper and/or codebook of the original study, the variable in the replication dataset that it 
corresponds to, and explain any deviations between the two. In cases where an equivalent 
replication variable was not found, explain how, if at all, you expect it will affect the replication 
attempt. In cases where you are adding a variable that was not present in the original study, 
please explicitly state that you are doing so, and explain how, if at all, you expect it will affect the 
replication attempt. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration surface all of the variables needed to replicate the focal 
analysis? 
● Are deviations between the original variables and replication variables documented 
when needed?

English ability 

 
● Dependent variable 
● English language achievement was assessed with a Cloze test (Lehmann & Lenkeit, 
2008). The test consists of four texts with 91 word completion questions measuring 
reading proficiency, vocabulary, grammar and spelling simultaneously. The items were 
scaled based on one-parameter item response theory in ConQuest (Wu et al., 1998). 
We used weighted likelihood estimates (WLEs) for individual person parameters. The 
WLEs were scaled with a mean parameter estimate of M =100 and a standard deviation 
of SD = 20 (original paper: page 79, section 2.2.1).·       
● ave_writing (PV1_WRIT_C, PV2_WRIT_C, PV3_WRIT_C, PV4_WRIT_C, 
PV5_WRIT_C), ave_reading (PV1_READ, PV2_READ, PV3_READ, PV4_READ, 
PV5_READ), and ave_listening (PV1_LIST, PV2_LIST, PV3_LIST, PV4_LIST, 
PV5_LIST)·       
● In the original article, the English ability was based on a single measure with different 
domains (i.e., reading proficiency, vocabulary, grammar and spelling) while in the 
replication we measured 3 English domains (i.e., writing, reading, and listening) 
separately. The reason for splitting the dataset was that a check-up analysis showed 
that, on average, students scored higher in listening and reading compared to writing, 
and students scored higher in listening compared to reading. Therefore, we decided to 
analyze these constructs separately, because each student is only measured in two of 
these three dimensions, which means that students that have scores on ‘reading’ and 
‘listening’ will systematically score higher in English (regardless of the independent 
variable) than students that have scores on reading/listening AND writing, biasing the 
results. 
Bilingualism 
● 
 Focal Independent Variable·       
● To identify bilingual groups, we analyzed the language spoken at home as well as the 
frequency of the language spoken at home as reported by the parents and students. 
Inclusion into one of the language groups was determined when the parents reported 
that a language other than German (the specific language was also identified) was 
regularly spoken in the home. If the parents' information was missing (24%), the 
information provided by the student was used. From the aforementioned criterion, we 
identified the monolingual group (n = 1896) and the bilingual group (n = 939). (original 
paper: page 79, section 2.1). 
● 
 I03_ST_A_S26A 
● 
In the replication, we did not have information about the language spoken at home. We 
only had information about how many languages were spoken at home (1, 2 or 3). This 
variable was re-coded so that if I03_ST_A_S26A = 1 (only one language spoken at home) 
means that the student is monolingual (Bilingual = 0) and if  I03_ST_A_S26A = 2 or 3 (two 
or more languages spoken at home), then the student is bilingual (Bilingual = 1). We 
should warn about the risk of proceeding this way: Maybe students that speak only one 
language at home (and therefore are considered monolinguals), speak a language 
different from the instructional (e.g., a minority language), being actually bilingual. There 
is no way to know this with the replication dataset, because the idiom spoken at home is 
not coded. 

 
 
Age      
● Control variable     
● Gender and age were reported in the fifth and sixth grade student questionnaires 
(original paper: page 79, section 2.2.2). 
● c_age (centered variable based on I08_ST_A_S02A) 
● There are no deviations from the procedure used in the original paper. 
 
Gender    
● Control variable    
● Gender and age were reported in the fifth and sixth grade student questionnaires 
(original paper: page 79, section 2.2.2). 
● SQt01i01 
● There are no deviations from the procedure used in the original paper. 
 
Socio-economic status (HISEI) 
● 
 Control variable 
● To measure the family's socio-economics status, we used the International Socio-
Economic Index (ISEI; Ganzeboom & Treiman, 1996), with the highest score of the two 
parents' socio-economic status (HISEI) serving as an indicator of family socio-economic 
status (original paper: page 80, section 2.2.2).       
● c_HISEI (centered variable based on HISEI)     
● There are no deviations from the procedure used in the original paper. 
 
Parental education   
● Control variable     
● The highest education of the parents was measured on a five-point scale with one 
indicating no qualification and five indicating a college-bound school diploma (original 
● paper: page 80, section 2.2.2). 
● Z_Parental (Z-scores the variable PARED) 
● In the original paper, this variable was coded on a 5-point scale, while in the replication, 
the variable is a numeric variable representing “Highest parental education expressed in 
years” 
  
Cultural capital 
● Control variable 
● Finally, to operationalize cultural capital, we used the number of books at home as a 
proxy variable, which was assessed on a four-point scale with one indicating 0-25 
● books and four indicating over 200 books. (original paper: page 80, section 2.2.2)     
● Z_Cultural (Z-scores transformed from Cultural_capital based on SQt21i01) 
● The variable was calculated differently than in the original paper. In the original paper, 
they reported the following values: 1 = 0-25 books and 4 = over 200 books. In the 
replication, we use the following values: 0 = 0-10 books,  1 = 11-25 books, 3 = 101-200 
books, 4 = 201-500 books, and 5 = More than 500 books. 

 
 
Cognitive abilities 
● Control variable       
● As general cognitive abilities might systematically differ across groups, we used a 
composite score of two subtests of the CFT4-12R: verbal and figural analogies (Heller & 
Perleth, 2000). This test consists of 25 picture and 20 word tasks subtests and was 
administered in the fourth grade. The test-retest reliability for this age group is ranalogies = 
0.83 and rfigural = 0.93 (Heller & Perleth, 2000).       
● There is no equivalent variable in the replication dataset.       
● This was an important variable to control for in the original paper, and we expect that this 
will affect the replication attempt. In the original paper, after controlling for cognitive 
abilities, “the Turkish-German bilingual group and the Other Bilingual group have, on 
average, no longer significant disadvantages and similar levels of English achievement 
as their monolingual peers.” (original paper, page 81). Therefore, if we find a difference 
we cannot be sure if that difference would not have resulted if this variable would have 
been controlled for. 
  
Country ID       
● Cluster variable       
● This variable was not used in the original study 
● country_id 
● We do not expect this variable to affect the replication attempt as it gives more control.  
 
School ID  
● Cluster variable       
● This variable was not used in the original study       
● School_id 
● We do not expect this variable to affect the replication attempt as it gives more control.  
18. Indices 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: If any of the measured variables described in Section 17 will be 
combined into a composite measure (including simply a mean), describe in detail what 
measures you will use and how they will be combined. Please be sure this preregistration 
includes a link to a clearly commented script that constructs the index according to the narrative. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
●  Does the preregistration specify each of the composite measures (e.g. mean scores, 
factor scores) that are needed for the focal analysis, and which of the measured 
variables in Section 17 are used in each one (e.g. the happiness, joy, and satisfaction 
items will be used to create the ‘positive feelings’ measure)? 
● Does the preregistration link to a clearly commented script that constructs the indices 
according to the narrative description? 
 

 
The variables described in point 16 are not part of other indices and will be used in the Analysis 
separately. The data transformations have been commented on point 17 above and point 19 
below.  
Analysis Plan 
19. Statistical models 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This section should describe in detail the analysis that will be 
performed to replicate the focal result. This analysis must align as closely as possible with the 
original study’s analysis, even if you have identified limitations in the original study. The level of 
detail should allow anyone to reproduce your analyses from your description below. Examples 
of what should be specified: the model; each variable; adjustments made to the standard errors 
and to case weighting; additional analyses that are required to set up the focal analysis; and the 
software used. 
 
Beyond the replication of the focal analysis from the original study, it is at your discretion to test 
the claim using other analytic approaches as a check of the robustness of the claim. The 
original test should be listed first and be clearly distinguished from any other tests. If you are 
testing additional confirmatory hypotheses, describe them in the same order as you numbered 
them in the “Hypotheses” section above and make clear reference to the specific hypothesis 
being tested for each. 
 
Please provide a link to a clearly commented script that performs the analysis described in the 
narrative provided below. Our preference is that this be either an R script or a script from 
another language that similarly allows for open and reproducible analyses. Please let the 
SCORE team know if this is not possible. Please also test that the code runs without error on a 
random subset of 5% of the replication dataset, and provide verification that the code has 
produced a sensible result below by providing a screenshot of the output (please upload the 
screenshot to the OSF as well). Finally, please confirm that you have only developed and tested 
your analysis plan and code using 5% of the data. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration specify which statistical model will be used to provide the ‘focal 
evidence’ for the SCORE test (e.g. a regression coefficient in a larger multiple 
regression model), and does it correspond closely to the model and evidence from the 
original study? 
● Does the preregistration describe each variable that will be included in the focal analysis, 
and what role each variable has (e.g. dependent variable, independent variable)? 
● Does the preregistration include a detailed specification of the focal analysis, including 
interactions, lagged terms, controls, etc., in both narrative form and in a clearly 
commented script? 
● Does the preregistration verify that the code runs without error on a random subset of 
the replication dataset? 

 
 
Four steps for data preparation: 
 
1. Data exclusion. The following observations were excluded from the analysis: 
 
The following missing data were observed and excluded. From the 20026 observations, 87 did 
not report information on the variable I03_ST_A_S26A, which is the variable used to classify 
participants in monolinguals or bilinguals.  Therefore, after removing these 87 observations, 
19939 participants were kept.  
From these 19939 observations, 569 participants were removed because no information was 
reported on the language they talked at home. Additionally, other 368 participants were 
excluded because they speak English (the target language) at home. After removing 937 
participants, 19002 observations were kept for the next analyses.  
At this point, the dataset was split in three datasets: one for writing, another from reading, and 
finally for listening. No missing values were observed in any of the items that measured each 
dimension as long as the student was measured on that dimension. That is, if a student was 
measured in WRITING and READING, no missing data was observed in any of the items that 
measure these dimensions, although of course the items measuring LISTENING were empty 
because the student wasn’t assessed in this dimension. 
According to section 13.7 of the technical report (that can be found here: https://osf.io/c6y8r/), 
“only students and schools that meet the formal criteria for participation have a weight in the 
datasets”. Therefore, for each separate analysis (i.e., reading, writing, and listening), the 
participants that did not have weight (i.e., missing value) or that had a weight of 0 were removed 
from the analysis. The names of the variables that have this information are: FSW_READ_TR 
(for reading), FSW_WRIT_TR (for writing), FSW_LIST_TR (for listening). In the table below it is 
indicated how many observations remained available after the exclusion of those observation 
where the weight was missing or equal to zero: 
 
  
Number of observations 
available for each 
dimension 
Number of observations 
available after removing no 
weights or weight = 0 
Writing 
12329 
10512 
Reading 
12723 
5406 
Listening 
12558 
10714 

 
 
The sample size in the last column was the final sample size available for each analysis.  
 
2. Data transformation.  
 
- 
The independent variable of this study is whether students speak more than 1 language 
at home. In the replication dataset, there is a variable (I03_ST_A_S26A) that measures the 
number of languages spoken at home: 1, 2 or 3. This variable was re-coded so that if 
I03_ST_A_S26A = 1 (only one language spoken at home) means that the student is monolingual 
(Bilingual = 0) and if  I03_ST_A_S26A = 2 or 3 (two or more languages spoken at home), then 
the student is bilingual (Bilingual = 1) 
 
    -The student’s performance on the target language (i.e., English) is measured in three 
dimensions: Reading, Writing and Listening. The dataset includes plausible values and plausible 
levels, but following the recommendations of the data finder, we used plausible values because 
they are numeric instead of character variables. Each of the three dimensions are measured 
through 5 items. Therefore, a global score of each dimension was calculated by obtaining the 
average across the 5 items (per dimension). 
 
    -The variable “Cultural capital” is recorded to convert it to a continuous variable. This variable 
has six categories: 
● “0-10 books” = 0 
● “11-25 books” = 1 
● “26-100 books” = 2 
● “101-200 books” = 3 
● “201-500 books” = 4 
● “More than 500 books” = 5 
    
     -After this point, three datasets are created, one for each dimension of the variable “English 
Proficiency”: Writing, Reading, and Listening. This procedure deviates from the procedure 
followed by the original paper, where a global average was calculated between measures of 
reading, vocabulary, grammar and spelling in English. The reason for splitting the dataset was 
that a check-up analysis showed that, on average, students scored higher in listening and reading 
compared to writing, and students scored higher in listening compared to reading. Therefore, we 
decided to analyze these constructs separately, because each student is only measured in two 
of these three dimensions, which means that students that have scores on ‘reading’ and ‘listening’ 
will systematically score higher in English (regardless of the independent variable) than students 
that have scores on reading/listening AND writing, biasing the results. The model used to test the 
difference between these three dimensions was a repeated-measures four-level model 
(measurements within cases, nested in schools, nested in countries), using as an independent 
variable the type of dimension used (i.e., writing, reading, listening). The dataset had to be 
transformed into a long format to carry out this check-up analysis.  
 

 
-For each of the three datasets (listening, writing and reading), the variables Age and HISEI 
(SES) were centered. 
 
  -For each of the three datasets (listening, writing and reading), Parental education and cultural 
capital are transformed to Z-scores. 
 
3. Data selection  
-5% of the students that belong to the bilingual group and 5% of the students that belong to the 
monolingual group were selected for each of the three datasets (which constitute 5% of the total 
dataset) 
 
4. Model 
-A multilevel three level model (cases within schools within countries) was fitted with the R 
package lmerTest, with intercept. The variables country_id and school_id were specified as 
random-effects, whereas the variables being bilingual or not (bilingual), gender (SQt01i01), age 
(c_age), HISEI (c_HISEI), parent qualification (Z_Parental) and cultural capital (Z_Cultural) 
where introduced as fixed effects. The estimation method selected was Restricted Maximum 
Likelihood (REML). The function used was lmer, from  lmerTest Package, which gives by default 
t-tests and degrees of freedom corrected by Satterthwaite's method. 
 
-R square was calculated with MuMIn package, using the function r.squaredGLMM, which gives 
the marginal R2 (variance explained by the fixed effects) and the conditional R2 (variance 
explained by the entire model, including both fixed and random effects) 
 
This statement confirms that only 5% of the data have been randomly sampled in 
developing the analysis plan and code contained in this preregistration.

20. Transformations 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This section should describe how any of the measured variables or  
composite measures mentioned above will be transformed prior to the analyses listed in Section 
19. These are adjustments made to variables after measurement or measure creation, and 
might include centering, logging, lagging, rescaling etc. Please provide enough detail such that 
anyone else could reproduce the transformations based on the description below. Please be 
sure this preregistration includes a link to a clearly commented script that performs the 
transformations described in the narrative provided below. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration specify which of the measured variables or composite 
measures will need to be transformed prior to the focal analysis? 
● For each variable needing transformation, does the preregistration adequately describe 
the transformations, including any centering, logging, lagging, recoding, or 
implementation of a coding scheme for categorical variables? 
● Does the preregistration link to a clearly commented script that performs each 
transformation? 
 
The following transformations were carried out: 
 
- 
The independent variable of this study is whether students speak more than 1 language 
at home. In the replication dataset, there is a variable (I03_ST_A_S26A) that measures 

 
the number of languages spoken at home: 1, 2 or 3. This variable was re-coded so that if 
I03_ST_A_S26A = 1 (only one language spoken at home) means that the student is 
monolingual (Bilingual = 0) and if  I03_ST_A_S26A = 2 or 3 (two or more languages 
spoken at home), then the student is bilingual (Bilingual = 1) 
 
    -The student’s performance on the target language (i.e., English) is measured in three 
dimensions: Reading, Writing and Listening. The dataset includes plausible values and plausible 
levels, but following the recommendations of the data finder, we used plausible values because 
they are numeric instead of character variables. Each of the three dimensions are measured 
through 5 items. Therefore, a global score of each dimension was calculated by obtaining the 
average across the 5 items (per dimension). 
 
    -The variable “Cultural capital” is recorded to convert it to a continuous variable. This variable 
has six categories: 
● “0-10 books” = 0 
● “11-25 books” = 1 
● “26-100 books” = 2 
● “101-200 books” = 3 
● “201-500 books” = 4 
● “More than 500 books” = 5 
    
     -After this point, three datasets are created, one for each dimension of the variable “English 
Proficiency”: Writing, Reading, and Listening. This procedure deviates from the procedure 
followed by the original paper, where a global average was calculated between measures of 
reading, vocabulary, grammar and spelling in English. The reason for splitting the dataset was 
that a check-up analysis showed that, on average, students scored higher in listening and reading 
compared to writing, and students scored higher in listening compared to reading. Therefore, we 
decided to analyze these constructs separately, because each student is only measured in two 
of these three dimensions, which means that students that have scores on ‘reading’ and ‘listening’ 
will systematically score higher in english (regardless of the independent variable) than students 
that have scores on reading/listening AND writing, biasing the results. The model used to test the 
difference between these three dimensions was a repeated-measures four-level model 
(measurements within cases, nested in schools, nested in countries), using as an independent 
variable the type of dimension used (i.e., writing, reading, listening). The dataset had to be 
transformed into a long format to carry out this check-up analysis.  
 
-For each of the three datasets (listening, writing and reading), the variables Age and HISEI 
(SES) were centered. 
 
  -For each of the three datasets (listening, writing and reading), Parental education and cultural 
capital are transformed to Z-scores. 
 

 
21. Inference criteria 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This section describes the precise criteria that will be used to 
assess whether the hypotheses listed above were confirmed by the analyses in Section 19. The 
default language below only applies to the test of the SCORE claim, H*. It is at your discretion to 
describe the inferential criteria you will use for any additional analyses. They need not rely on p-
values and/or the same alpha level we have specified for H*.  
 
If the additional analyses will use multiple comparisons, the inference criteria is a question with 
few “wrong” answers. In other words, transparency is more important than any specific method 
of controlling the false discovery rate or false error rate. One may state an intention to report all 
tests conducted or one may conduct a specific correction procedure; either strategy is 
acceptable. 
 
Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project is a statistically significant 
effect (alpha = .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal hypothesis 
test (H*). The main outcome that will be directly compared to the main dependent variable of the 
original paper will be the composite score of English ability (average of writing, reading, and 
listeting measures), so a significant difference between bilinguals and monolinguals in this 
outcome (alpha = .05, two tailed) in two different regression models will be considered as a 
successful replication. In the first regression model, only the variable bilinguals-monolingual will 
be included (as in Model A of Table 3 of the original paper) and in a second model, the control 
variables (Except for cognitive ability) will be entered in the regression (as in Model B of Table 
3). Therefore, a significant effect of the variable “being bilingual or monolingual” on a 
composite English score in both an empty model and a model with control variables will 
be considered as a successful replication.   
 
However, check-up analyses showed that using a composite score in the replication dataset 
could induce bias. Therefore, the analyses described above will be also done for each English 
measure separately.  For these analyses, a successful replication will be considered if 
significant differences are observed between the bilingual and monolingual group in at least one 
of these three dimensions. Correction for multiple comparisons has to be applied, so it is 
recommended that alpha is lowered from 0.05 to 0.017. 
 
22. Data exclusion 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: The section below should describe the rules you will follow to 
exclude collected cases from the analyses described in Section 19. Note that this refers to 
exclusions after the creation of the replication dataset; exclusion criteria that prevent a case 
from entering the replication dataset in the first place should be detailed in the ‘Data Collection 
Procedure’ section above. Please be as detailed as possible in describing the rules you will 
follow (e.g. What is the specific definition of outliers you will use? Exactly how many attention 
checks does a participant need to fail before their removal from the analytic sample?). 
 

 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration comment on whether any cases included in the replication 
dataset will be excluded prior to data analysis? 
● If yes, does the preregistration provided detailed instructions on how the exclusions will 
be performed (e.g. Is the definition of outlier provided? Is the number of attention checks 
failed before a participant is excluded specified?) 
 
The following observations were excluded from the analysis: 
 
-Participants who spoke the target language (English) at home. This is measured with the variable 
I03_ST_A_S27B = 1. For this reason, a total of 369 participants were removed from the 
replication dataset. 
 
-According to section 13.7 of the technical report (that can be found here: https://osf.io/c6y8r/), 
“only students and schools that meet the formal criteria for participation have a weight in the 
datasets”. Therefore, for each separate analysis (i.e., reading, writing, and listening), the 
participants that did not have weight (i.e., missing value) or that had a weight of 0 were removed 
from the analysis. The names of the variables that have this information are: FSW_READ_TR 
(for reading), FSW_WRIT_TR (for writing), FSW_LIST_TR (for listening). This exclusion led to 
the removal of 8314 participants (for reading), 8298 (for writing), and 2827 participants (for 
listening) 
23. Missing data 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: The section below should describe how missing or incomplete 
data will be handled. Please be as detailed as possible in describing the exact procedures you 
will follow (e.g. last value carried forward; mean imputation) and any software required (e.g. We 
will use Amelia II in R to perform the imputation). 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration comment on how missing or incomplete data will be addressed 
(e.g. casewise removal, missing data imputation)? 
● If applicable, does the preregistration specify how many missing variables will lead to a 
case’s removal (e.g. If a subject does not complete any of the three indices of tastiness, 
that subject will not be included in the analysis.)? 
● If applicable, does the preregistration describe how missing data imputation will be 
performed, including relevant software? 
 
 
No imputation of missing data was performed. In the original paper, authors did multiple 
imputation with MPlus following a theoretical model proposed by Lehmann and Lenkeit, 2008. 
However, in the replication dataset, no missing data was observed in the dependent variable. All 
the participants that were supposed to fill in, for instance, the reading and writing dimension, 
filled in all the items that referred to this dimension. There is not one single piece of data 
missing in this sense. If we assume that each participant was randomly assigned to fill in two 

 
out of the three dimensions of the English ability construct, then the fact that some scores are 
missing for one of these dimensions should not constitute a problem. 
24. Exploratory analysis (Optional) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected 
differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test 
where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to 
use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new 
confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time. If any exploratory analyses 
involve additions to the data collection procedure beyond what was performed in the original 
study (e.g. additional items on the survey; running another condition in the experiment), please 
describe them below. 
 
As an exploratory analysis, we calculate an overall average across the three dimensions of the 
English proficiency construct (calculating the average of the three average scores of writing, 
listening and reading). A three-level model was run on this new dependent variable on 5% of the 
dataset. This analysis resembles the analyses done by the original paper, but due to the way 
data was collected in the replicated dataset (i.e., only two measures by student), this analysis 
might lead to biased results.  
 
An additional exploratory analysis consisted in analyzing the items of each dimension directly 
without calculating an overall effect for each dimension. That is, the score of the 5 items of each 
dimension were kept, and an additional level of variation was added in the multilevel model, 
leading to a four-level model: items (Level 1) were nested within cases (Level 2), which were 
nested within schools (Level 3), which were nested within countries (Level 4). These analyses 
were done for each dimension separately (one analysis for the items of Writing, another 
analysis for the items of Reading, and a last analysis for the items of Listening), but also for all 
the items together, without differentiating between dimensions. This last analysis resembles the 
first exploratory analysis that was done, in which all items were pooled together, regardless of 
the type of dimensions they measure.   
 
From these exploratory analyses, it could be concluded that the same results are obtained 
regardless of whether items are pooled together in an overall score and a three-level model is 
performed, or whether separate item scores are preserved and analyzed within a four-level 
model.  
25. Other 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This section serves two purposes. First, please use this section to 
discuss any features of your replication plan that are not discussed elsewhere. Literature cited, 
disclosures of any related work such as replications or work that uses the same data, plans to 
make your data and materials public, or other context that will be helpful for future readers 
would be appropriate here. Second, please also re-surface any major deviations from earlier in 
the preregistration that you expect a reasonable reviewer could flag for concern. Give a 

 
summary of these deviations, focusing on larger changes and any possible challenges for 
comparing the results of the original and replication study. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration reference other sections of the preregistration where substantial 
deviations from the original study have been described (including deviations due to 
differences in location or time compared to the original study)?  
● Does the preregistration comment on plans to make the data and materials from the 
replication study public? 
 
 
We have two major concerns about the potential use of these dataset to replicate the results of 
Maluch et al. (2015). The first one is that the mean age (and it’s standard deviation) of the 
current dataset deviates from the one of the original study: 
 
Age in the original sample: 
Bilingual group 
mean = 12.71 (SD=0.70) 
 
Monolingual group: 
mean = 12.49 (SD=0.49) 
 
Age in the current sample:  
Bilingual group 
mean = 15.0 (SD=0.89) 
 
Monolingual group: 
mean = 15.0 (SD=0.92) 
 
The current sample is on average older than the original sample, and the age varies more in the 
current sample (i.e., the standard deviation is lager) than in the original sample. Therefore, we 
are not sure of whether the sample of this current dataset can be considered similar to the 
original one. 
 
Secondly, we think that there is a major concern with the data available for this replication that 
does not allow us to confirm that "we believe it represents a good-faith replication attempt of the 
original focal claim" (the last point of the "Final review checklist"). 
 
In the original study, the authors insist on controlling for certain socio-demographic 
variables, that are very relevant for obtaining the final results. One of these variables is 
'cognitive ability'. Find here some textual sentences of the original study: 
 

 
-Indeed, once controlling for general cognitive abilities, gender and age, the Turkish-German 
bilingual group and the Other Bilingual group have, on average, no longer significant 
disadvantages and similar levels of English achievement as their monolingual peers (page 
81). 
-All comparisons of the different groups of elementary school students were conducted 
controlling for sociocultural background factors and general cognitive abilities. (page 82). 
 
   Unfortunately, this variable is not included in the replication dataset, and we have serious 
doubt about the validity of the results if analyses are not controlled by this variable.   
 
   Another concern relates to the variable 'proficiency of the instructional language'. The 
major finding of the original study is that the relationship between bilingualism and English 
proficiency is highly moderated by the proficiency of the instructional language at home.  
 
- Original hypothesis was: “In the present study, we seek to determine whether there is a 
relation between immigrant bilingualism and foreign language learning outcomes and to 
what extent the predicted pattern holds across bilingual groups with different instructional 
language proficiency and diverse home languages.” 
-For these reasons, it is useful to pay particular attention to the specific language groups as 
well as language proficiency to better understand the underlying mechanisms. 
- Failing to take these factors into account may be leading to biased conclusions in 
empirical studies and potentially masking possible advantages for immigrant bilingual 
groups. 
-In addition to the large contrast in sociocultural and linguistic background characteristics, 
which might account for the varying results in the aforementioned studies, another 
important factor that can affect foreign language learning is the proficiency level in the 
language of instruction. 
 
However, this other analysis cannot be replicated because that variable is not included in 
the replicated dataset. We understand that this is not the focal analysis and that is why we 
see this one less of a concern. Nonetheless, we think it was worth noticing these issues 
here.

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication strictly followed its preregistered pipeline\u2014loading the supplied .rds file, constructing the bilingual flag, computing an averaged English-achievement score, and estimating a mixed-effects model with the preregistered controls and random intercepts for schools nested in countries.  Code issues encountered during execution (a dtype problem for the \u2018books at home\u2019 variable) were patched, after which the analysis ran successfully on 14,968 students across 773 schools.  Substantively, however, the sign of the bilingual coefficient reversed: whereas the original ELEMENT study reported a positive association of +2.68 WLE points (p < .01), the replication produced a significantly negative coefficient of \u20130.337 (SE = 0.025, p < .001).  Thus, using a markedly larger and more heterogeneous international dataset, the preregistered criterion for confirming the claim (positive and significant effect) was not met.",

The executed script mirrors the preregistered steps: listwise deletion, computation of mean plausible-values, recoding of covariates, and estimation of a linear mixed-effects model via statsmodels.  Random intercepts for schools within countries replicate the intended cluster structure.  Minor code fixes (casting categorical \u2018books\u2019 to numeric) did not alter analytic strategy.",

Sensitivity analyses by country or grade level, and inclusion of cognitive-ability controls (not available in the replication dataset), would further clarify comparability."

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

    Replication attempt to evaluate a claim 
from Maluch_LearnInst_2015_5Awm 
Replication team: Belén Fernández-Castilla, David Santos. 
SCORE RR ID: 2y2g 
OSF Project: https://osf.io/k6xm9 
Instructions 
For each claim that you are evaluating in this replication attempt, please complete all 
sections below. Please feel free to remove these and the other instructions for the final 
report that you provide on OSF. 
Each claim evaluation must include a binary determination of whether or not the claim was 
replicated, given the inferential criteria. In other words, a sentence along the lines of “This 
claim [was/was not] replicated.” should appear in every claim evaluation. You can (and 
should!) also articulate in your discussion why this interpretation may be limited, but 
programmatic requirements of the SCORE project at large include the binary decision so it 
must be present. 
There are also specific requirements for reporting the results of inferential tests: 
•             Any p-value should be reported as an exact value, not a threshold, e.g.“p = .047” 
rather than “p < .05”. Please also indicate whether it is from a one- or two-tailed 
test. 
•             Report the full text of your results with as much precision as possible. For 
example, a satisfactory report for the focal coefficient might be “unstandardized 
OLS coefficient for income term = 0.342367” vs an unsatisfactory report of “beta = 
0.34”. 
•             Please verify that for any test that was used as the basis for a power analysis, 
you are reporting the same effect size type used in that power analysis. It may not 
be the same type of effect size as was reported in the original paper (e.g., we 
convert to Cohen’s f squared to power many regression analyses, which is not 
commonly reported). 
•             For any test that does not have a corresponding power analysis, please provide 
an effect size that corresponds to one from the original paper to the extent 
possible. 

•             In the case of a regression analysis, please report the most unstandardized 
coefficient possible, e.g., the log-odds instead of the odds ratio. You may also 
report standardized values. 
•             If there are multiple cells/conditions or levels to your analysis, please provide the 
sample sizes for each cell or level, e.g., “234823 participants nested within 32 
countries” or “angry condition n = 83, happy condition n = 85”. 
•             If multiple claims are evaluated using the same model, it is ok to group them 
together. In that case, please ensure that it is still clear which specific 
test/coefficient corresponds to which claim ID, and that there is still an evaluation 
of whether each claim replicated or not. 
•             Scientific notation is acceptable for especially small or large values. 
These requirements apply to all “simple” tests (one inferential test expected to be significant) 
and any inferential test contained within a “complex” test of a claim. 
If applicable, please also distinguish which results come from an analysis of (a) entirely new 
data, (b) “hybrid” data (composed of both data that was used in the original study and new 
data), and/or (c) entirely original data. 
Description of generalizability 
[Please add any other details to describe how this study departs from the original study, and 
how it speaks to the original claim(s).] 
-The nationality of the sample is different. In the original study, they used a sample of 2,835 
German 6th-graders (Arabic-German: n = 105, Chinese-German: n = 110, Polish-German: n 
= 57, Turkish-German: n = 383, heterogeneous bilingual: n = 284, and monolingual German 
group: n = 1896). In the replication study, we used a sample of 20,026 students from 14 
differente participating countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, England, Estonia, France, 
Greece, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden). The claim that the 
original authors make might only apply to German participants, and not to participants from 
other countries. 
-In the original study, authors assessed English ability with a different instrument. Specifically, 
original autors used the Cloze test (consisting of four texts with 91 word completion questions 
measuring reading proficiency, vocabulary, grammar and spelling simultaneously). In contrast, 
the proposed replication dataset includes measurements of students listening, reading and 
writing abilities taken from The European Survey on Language Competences (ESLC) from 
2012. In the replication, a composite English ability score between these three dimensions 
was calculated. This composite score might be biased because it is an average of three 
dimensions (students' listening, reading and writing abilities). In fact, check up analyses 
carried out by the replication team found that students that responded to the wirting ability test 
scored, on average, significantly lower than those who responded to the reading and listening 
skills. That is, it seems that these three scales might measure different dimensions of the 

construct “English ability”. In this regard, check up analyses were performed, and the main 
claim was tested for each category of English ability.  
-The average age in the replication sample is statistically larger than the mean age of the 
original sample. The mean age in the original study was 12.71 for the bilingual group (SD = 
0.70, 95% CI [12.87, 12.75]) and 12.49 for the monolingual group (SD = 0.49, 95% CI [12.47, 
12.51). In contrast, in the replication sample, the mean age for the bilingual group was 15 (SD 
= 0.89, 95% CI [14.99, 15.01]) and for the monolingual group was also 15 (SD = 0.92, 95% CI 
[14.97, 15.03]). The 95% confidence intervals show that the mean age of the replication 
sample was significantly larger than the man age of the original sample. This difference in the 
mean age could lead to substantial differences in the findings of the original and replication 
study. 
-In the original study, authors used as a control variable a measure of cognitive ability. 
Specifically, they mentioned “As general cognitive abilities might systematically differ across 
groups, we used a composite score of two subtests of the CFT4-12R: verbal and figural 
analogies (Heller & Perleth, 2000). This test consists of 25 picture and 20 word tasks subtests 
and was administered in the fourth grade. TFor cognitive ability, the replication study does not 
have this measure.” (page 79 in the original paper). There is no such a measure in the 
replication database to control for. Thus, this is another difference between the original study 
and the replication study. Not controlling for this variable might lead to differences in the 
findings from the original and replication study. 
Claim evaluation 
Single-trace claim 
Coded claim 4 text (original paper): “…However, this negative relation is reversed once 
the background characteristics of general cognitive abilities, age, gender, socio-economic 
status, parental education, and cultural capital have been taken into account (Model B). 
Given comparable individual and familiar background characteristics bilingual group 
membership is positively associated with English foreign language achievement (from Model 
B in Table 3, ‘Bilingual (=1)’ variable: estimate = 2.68; p < .01).” 
Replication outcome: Simple test 
Inferential criteria: The main outcome that will be directly compared to the main dependent 
variable of the original paper will be the composite score of English ability (average of writing, 
reading, and listeting measures), so a significant difference between bilinguals and 
monolinguals in this outcome (alpha = .05, two tailed) will be considered as a successful 
replication in the model where control variables are included (replicating Model B of the original 
paper). 
To assess the main claim, a three-level model was fitted with the R package lmerTest, with 
intercept. The dependent variable was a composite English score (average between writing, 
reading and listening scores). The independent variables were: being bilingual or not 
(bilingual), gender (SQt01i01), age (c_age), HISEI (c_HISEI), parent qualification (Z_Parental) 

and cultural capital (Z_Cultural) (please note that cognitive ability was missing in the 
replication dataset). All these independent variables were introduced as fixed effects. 
Observations from students were nested within schools and within countries. To have this 
nestig into account, the factors country_id and school_id were specified as random-effects. 
The estimation method selected was Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML). The function 
used was lmer, from lmerTest Package, which gives by default t-tests and degrees of freedom 
corrected by Satterthwaite's method. The regression coefficiens (B) reported below are 
unstandardized, and they refer to the effect of the foca independent variable “being bilingual 
or not”. Standardized regression coefficients are also reported for this variable with the symbol 
ß (the function to calculate them can be found in the R script). The 𝑅2 statistic reported below 
refers to a Pseudo-R-squared for Generalized Mixed-Effect model (r.squared function from 
package MuMIn). Specifically, the 𝑅2 statistic reported here refers to the marginal 𝑅2, which 
is the percentage of variance explained only by the fixed effects in the regression model. The 
tests were two-sided.  
Result:  
Main claim: A significant difference between bilinguals and monolinguals in this outcome (a 
composite English score, alpha = .05, two tailed) will be considered as a successful replication 
in the model where control variables are included (replicating Model B of the original paper). 
With 16185 students, nested in 773 schools and 11 countries, we found that, when controlling 
for sociodemographic variables, the bilingual group scored significantly higher in the 
composite English score than the non-bilingual group (B = 0.35, SE = 0.03, t(14555) =13.72, 
p = 2.2e-16, 𝑅2 = 9.6%, ß =  0.08). Therefore, the main claim of the original paper is 
replicated. 
Results from the model that includes control variables: 

 
Deviations from the preregistration: We have followed the plan stipulated in the pre-
registration 
Discussion: The main claim of Maluch et al. (2015) study is replicated in this replication study: 
when controlling for sociodemographic variables (even if cognitive ability is missing), bilingual 
participantes scored higher in English ability than monolingual individuals. However, the 𝑅2 
we have found for this model (𝑅2 = .096) is less than half of that 𝑅2 reported by the original 
authors (𝑅2= .26). A possible explanatiton is that in our replication study, the variable cognitive 
ability was not avaiable, and that variable might explain that piece of variance that we failed 
to explain with our model.  
 
Additional analyses (optional) 
Instructions: If you performed any additional analyses, please report them here. Otherwise 
you may delete this section. 
The same set of three level models were carried out separately for each English outcomes 
(writing, reading and listening), and the main claim was replicated with all of these three 
outcomes: when controlling for sociodemographic variables, the English reading skills of the 
bilinguals participants were significantly higher than in the group of monolingual participants 
(B= 0.23, SE = 0.04, t(4773) = 6.49, p = 9.28e-11 , 𝑅2 = 11.74%; ß =  0.07), and the same 
occured with the English listening skills (B= 0.26, SE = 0.02, t(9528) = 12.88, p = 2.2e-16, 𝑅2 
= 8.8%; ß =  0.08,) and the English writting skills (B= 0.57, SE = 0.05, t(9631) = 11.46, p = 
2.2e-16, 𝑅2= 10.7%; ß =  0.08).  

General discussion (optional) 
Instructions: If you would like to make any broad comments about this replication attempt, 
please do so here. Otherwise you may delete this section. 
In terms of statistical significance, we consider that our replication study succesfully replicates 
the original finding of Maluch et al. (2015). We have replicated the finding of Maluch et al. 
(2015) using different measures of English ability: first a composite score, and then three 
different dimensions: writing, reading and listening skills. The results were very similar across 
dependente variables, which could be an indicator of the robustness of the results. 
However, both the original and the replication study have a very large sample size, making it 
very likely that any small effect becomes statistically relevant even if, in reality, it is not. In this 
sense, the 𝑅2 statistics found in this replication study are smaller than those reported by the 
original authors. Furthermore, the lack of standardized regression coeffients in the original 
study did not allow us to compare whether the maginute of the effects are comparable across 
the original and replication study. 
 
Description of materials provided  
Instructions: Please detail the materials that will be available on OSF or another repository 
from this project. This section should describe both what is available and whether it can be 
shared publicly or not. If all files can be shared publicly, it is alright to include a general 
sharing statement to the effect of “All materials on this OSF project may be shared publicly.” 
Otherwise, please indicate sharing permissions for each file. 
For any materials that will not be shared on OSF or another repository by you, and are 
instead available through other means, please include a description of how someone else 
might access those materials. 
We recommend including an entry for each file that indicates what that file is and its intended 
use. For example: 
•             experiment_script.txt - the wording used by the experimenter for consent, 
instructions, and debriefing 
If you have many files which are similar, e.g., stimuli from an experiment, datasets from the 
same source, etc., it is reasonable to describe them generally instead of individually, 
including any guidance on naming conventions and a tally of such files so others can verify 
they have all expected files. For example: 
•             condition_num.png - There are 60 images (15 per condition) used as stimuli, 
labeled by condition and ordered by num which has a base-0 index, e.g., the 4th 
image in the “angry” condition is named “angry_03.png” 
The minimum requirements for materials include: 

1.          Analysis pipeline: This may take the form of a script (or scripts) that process and 
then analyze your data, and/or detailed instructions for how these steps are 
accomplished if you do them manually (e.g., in Excel or via the GUI of your chosen 
statistical software). 
2.          Full results/output: Please provide the full output from your analysis, preferably 
with comments that identify which claim is being evaluated by each test. 
Depending on your chosen software, this may be one of a variety of file types. You 
may provide the default, but please also provide a version that is non-proprietary 
so that it may be viewed by someone who does not have your given software. Txt, 
PDF, markdown, and HTML are some common options that are not reliant on 
proprietary statistical software. 
3.          Data: All versions of your data should be provided. For all projects, the “raw”, i.e., 
earliest tabular version of your data should be available, and if other versions are 
generated during your analysis pipeline they should also be shared. At minimum, 
your data should be shared in a non-proprietary file-type such as a csv or tsv; you 
may also share versions that correspond to your chosen statistical software such 
as .sav or .dta. It may not always be possible to share data on OSF directly if there 
are any ethical or legal constraints on sharing, e.g., if it is existing data that are 
proprietary or include sensitive participant information. In those cases, please 
provide instructions for how another person might access the data. 
4.          Data dictionary: This is also sometimes called a codebook in some fields. This 
file (or files) should describe every variable in your dataset. This guide provides 
more information about how to make one. For projects which rely on existing data, 
it is possible that a codebook already exists for that data from the source. It is 
satisfactory to either provide that file again if its license/permissions allow 
redistribution, or to provide guidance on how to access it if that is not the case. 
5.          Study materials: There is not a one-size-fits-all requirement to describe the other 
materials that are relevant to every project, but you should also share whatever 
materials another researcher would need to run your study in their own lab. We 
may make specific requests during report review if we believe additional materials 
could be provided that would improve the transparency of your project.

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication used a Python MixedLM approximation on an independent, much larger multi-country dataset to test whether bilingual status predicts English language achievement controlling for background variables. The executed models included gender, age (binned), SES (HISEI), parental education, and cultural capital, with random intercepts by school and a country variance component. Across average English and domain subscores (writing, reading, listening), the bilingual coefficient was positive and highly significant, consistent with the original study\u2019s positive association (estimate = 2.68 WLE points; p < .01). However, several deviations limit magnitude comparability: different dataset and outcome scaling (standardized domain scores/average vs IRT WLE Cloze), listwise deletion rather than multiple imputation, random-effects modeling rather than type=complex clustering, and omission of cognitive ability and German reading proficiency controls. Overall, the replication supports the directional hypothesis with stronger statistical significance, while effect sizes cannot be directly compared.",

It adhered to the preregistered plan to translate R code to Python, fit the planned model classes, and report coefficients and p-values. Deviations include use of an independent RDS dataset, MixedLM with random intercepts (school, country) instead of Mplus type=complex clustering, listwise deletion instead of multiple imputation, and omission of cognitive ability and German reading proficiency among controls.

The dataset appears multi-country with 770+ school groups, distinct from the original single-city ELEMENT sample, which may alter context and generalizability. Age was modeled via categorical bins; consider continuous specification. Given omitted cognitive and language proficiency controls, conduct robustness checks including these predictors if available. Recommend sensitivity analyses for missing data and outcome scaling to strengthen comparability."

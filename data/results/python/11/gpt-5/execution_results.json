After fixing a Patsy formula mutation bug, the analysis executed successfully. Artifacts (summaries, fixed-effect tables, standardized coefficients, and a run_summary.json) were saved to /app/data and mirrored to /workspace/artifacts. The focal bilingual coefficient is positive and statistically significant across all outcomes.",

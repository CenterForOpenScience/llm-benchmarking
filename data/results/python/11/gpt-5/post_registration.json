      "description": "The study conducted secondary analyses of a representative sixth-grade sample from the ELEMENT study to examine whether speaking a minority language at home, in addition to the school instructional language (German), is associated with higher achievement in English as a foreign language. English achievement was measured with a Cloze test scaled via IRT. Bilingualism was operationalized using reported home language, and bilingual subgroups were formed (Arabic-German, Chinese-German, Polish-German, Turkish-German, and heterogeneous \u2018other\u2019). The analyses controlled for general cognitive abilities, age, gender, socio-economic status (HISEI), parental education, cultural capital (books at home), and German reading proficiency. Missing data were handled via multiple imputation, and clustering at the class level was accounted for in regression models.",

        "Conduct descriptive statistics for groups using the first imputed dataset with Bonferroni adjustments.",
        "Estimate multiple regression models (Mplus, type = complex) predicting English achievement from: (a) bilingual status; (b) bilingual status by German proficiency levels; (c) bilingual language group dummies; sequentially add controls (cognitive abilities, age, gender, HISEI, parental education, cultural capital), and finally add German reading proficiency.",

      "summary": "Controlling for socio-demographic and cognitive factors, speaking a minority language at home (bilingualism) was positively associated with English foreign language achievement. The advantage varied across bilingual groups: Chinese-German and Polish-German students showed clear benefits, the heterogeneous bilingual group also benefited, Turkish-German showed advantages when German reading proficiency was controlled, and Arabic-German performed similarly to monolinguals after controls. Proficiency in the instructional language (German) was the strongest predictor of English achievement; adding German proficiency substantially increased explained variance.",

Models include fixed effects and random effects specifications, Prais-Winsten models with panel-corrected standard errors for fixed effects, and hybrid models to separate within- and between-state effects. A set of economic, political, and demographic control variables are included, and robustness/sensitivity checks are performed.",

      "summary": "Across multiple panel model specifications (fixed effects, random effects, Prais-Winsten PCSE, and hybrid models), average weekly working hours are positively associated with state-level CO2 emissions. Reported elasticities indicate that a 1% increase in average working hours is associated with roughly a 0.55%\u20130.67% increase in CO2 emissions depending on model and specification. Results are robust across models and sensitivity checks; total population and energy production are consistently positive and significant predictors of emissions, while some demographic controls (manufacturing % GDP, household size, working-age population %) are often non-significant. Hybrid models confirm a positive within-state association (coefficients ~0.633\u20130.635, p < 0.01). The authors interpret findings as evidence that reducing working hours could contribute to emission reductions (via scale and composition effects) while providing social benefits.",

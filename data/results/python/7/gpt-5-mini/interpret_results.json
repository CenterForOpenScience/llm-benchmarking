  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the preregistered plan (OLS of election fraud on violence and violence^2 with population and turnout controls). Execution completed successfully and produced coefficient estimates for the focal quadratic model. The replication produced a positive linear violence term and a negative quadratic term, both statistically significant at p<0.05, and both replication point estimates fall within the original paper's 95% confidence intervals. Overall, the replication supports the original inverted U-shaped relationship, with similar magnitudes but slightly larger standard errors in the replication.",

  "notes": "Caveats: replication SEs are slightly larger which modestly increases uncertainty \u2014 recommended additional robustness checks (e.g., heteroskedasticity-robust SEs, clustered SEs if appropriate, alternative functional forms, and influence diagnostics). Also recommend sharing the exact analysis script and a README documenting environment/versioning so others can re-run and extend checks. The saved plot (replication_data/plot.png) supports visual inspection of the fitted inverted U-shaped curve."

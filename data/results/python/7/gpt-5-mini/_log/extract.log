--- PDF SUMMARY (Document was 24 pages long) ---
The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

The study examines the relationship between working hours and carbon dioxide emissions at the state level in the United States from 2007 to 2013, underscoring how reducing working time could mitigate climate change. The researchers found a strong positive correlation between state-level carbon emissions and average working hours across various models, even after accounting for political, economic, and demographic factors.

Key methodologies included sub-national analysis across all 50 U.S. states to explore the association between state-level emissions and work hours, which had not been previously studied. This approach is considered significant due to policy sensitivities to state-level dynamics, unlike federal policy, which has seen little change regarding working hours since the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

Specific metrics involved average weekly working hours and state-level carbon emissions data from 2007 to 2013. The study found that longer working hours correspond with higher carbon emissions. This connection was attributed to two effects: the scale effect (impact on GDP growth and thus emissions) and the composition effect (influence on household consumption patterns and associated emissions).

Results from this study suggest that reducing working hours could be a viable strategy for mitigating emissions while also improving quality of life and reducing unemployment. This policy could be particularly relevant given federal government's current stance against aggressive mitigation actions and the increasing role of state-level climate policies in the U.S.

In conclusion, the study argues for the benefits of reduced working hours as a multiple dividend approach, potentially addressing climate change while offering social and economic benefits such as enhanced quality of life and employment.

The paper explores the relationship between economic growth, technological advancements, and environmental sustainability, with a focus on the concepts of "rebound effects" and the "Jevons paradox," which suggest that advancements may not necessarily lead to sustainability. Key findings from sociological research indicate that while Environmental Modernization Theory (EMT) shows some decoupling of economic growth from environmental harm at lower levels of analysis, higher levels like national or global scales show minimal evidence of decoupling, especially for global pollutants like carbon and methane emissions. Particularly, the paper differentiates between "absolute" and "relative" decoupling, noting that for effective climate change mitigation, absolute reductions in CO2 emissions are necessary, making reliance on economic growth as a mitigation strategy contentious.

The discussion leads to the concept of economic degrowth, which stems from critiques of the failure of wealthy countries to decouple economic output from emissions. This argument revives the "limits to growth" discourse from the 1970s, emphasizing systemic changes like reducing economic growth to avoid ecological catastrophe. Various scholars propose approaches like steady-state economies, sufficiency, a-growth, and degrowth as alternatives to growth-focused policies.

Degrowth is also linked to working hours reduction as a strategy to mitigate unemployment due to economic contraction, technological displacement (notably from AI and automation), and to yield ecological benefits. The text explains that reducing working hours could help distribute labor more evenly and reduce carbon emissions. This is expressed through "scale" and "composition" effects. The scale effect describes how increasing working hours leads to higher economic output and consumption, while the composition effect refers to lifestyle changes resulting from more available time, which could lead to less ecologically intensive behaviors.

Contributions of this research include the identification of working time as a key factor in both economic structures and consumer culture, and a call for policies aiming to reduce working hours as part of a broader degrowth strategy. This aligns with a critique of consumption-driven economic models and suggests a transition towards more sustainable and equitable economic practices.

The study explores the relationship between working hours and carbon emissions at the US state level from 2007 to 2013, building on previous research indicating that longer working hours correlate with increased ecological and carbon footprints. The sample includes annual observations for all 50 US states, resulting in a balanced panel dataset with 350 total observations.

**Key Methodologies:**
- **Data Collection:** Carbon dioxide emissions data were gathered from the US EPA, based on fuel consumption data from the US Department of Energy. Average weekly working hours data were collected from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' Current Employment Statistics (CES) database.
- **Model Estimation Techniques:** Both fixed effects and random effects panel regression models were used to assess the relationship between working hours and emissions. Fixed effects models address time-invariant factors, while random effects models include both time-invariant factors and analyze variation within and between states. Prais-Winsten models with panel corrected standard errors (PCSEs) were estimated for the fixed effects models.

**Specific Metrics:**
- **Dependent Variable:** State-level carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion, measured in million metric tons (MMTCO2).
- **Independent Variable:** Average weekly working hours per worker.
- **Control Variables:** Included state population size, manufacturing percentage of GDP, energy production, working-age population percentage, average household size, labor productivity, and employment to population ratio.

**Results and Conclusions:**
- The study found a positive correlation between state-level working hours and carbon emissions.
- States with higher average weekly working hours, such as Texas and Louisiana, exhibited higher carbon emissions compared to states like Hawaii and Wisconsin with lower working hours.
- Over a year, the differences in working hours between states can be significant, with Texas workers working approximately 167 more hours annually than Hawaii workers, suggesting substantial environmental impacts.
- The research underscores the potential for working time reduction as a measure to reduce carbon emissions and enhance life quality, offering a "triple dividend" of reduced unemployment, increased quality of life, and reduced environmental pressures.

Overall, the study contributes to the literature by providing state-level insights into the relationship between working hours and carbon emissions, highlighting the potential environmental benefits of policies targeting reduced working hours.

The study examines the relationship between working hours and carbon emissions across U.S. states using data from 2007 to 2013. It uses environmental voting scores and various economic and demographic factors to analyze this relationship. The main methodologies include panel regression models with fixed and random effects. Four models were analyzed: Model 1 and Model 3 for the scale effect of working hours, and Model 2 and Model 4 for the composition effect of working hours on emissions. Control variables include GDP per hour/capita, total population, energy production, and manufacturing as a percentage of GDP.

Key findings include:
- A 1% increase in average working hours results in a 0.668% (Model 1) to 0.654% (Model 3) increase in carbon emissions for the scale effect.
- The composition effect shows a 0.675% (Model 2) to 0.552% (Model 4) increase in carbon emissions per 1% increase in working hours.
- Total population and energy production consistently show positive and significant impacts on emissions across all models.
- State environmentalism is negatively associated with emissions, highlighting regional variations.
- Manufacturing (% of GDP), average household size, and working-age population percentage had non-significant effects. 

Additional analyses with hybrid models and sensitivity checks confirmed robustness, indicating no influential outliers or cases affecting results. The study suggests that reducing working hours may be a viable approach to decrease emissions while considering economic and demographic factors. Concluding, it supports the notion of degrowth for emission reduction to meet climate targets.

The study examines the relationship between state-level working hours and carbon emissions across all 50 US states, motivated by the federal government's slow action on climate change. It highlights how longer work hours contribute to increased emissions through both scale and composition effects, with findings indicating that longer work hours increase carbon emissions, even when accounting for GDP, labor productivity, and employment-population ratios.

The analysis uses hybrid regression models over the years 2007-2013. Specifically, Model 5 and Model 6 show that working hours are positively associated with CO2 emissions, with coefficients of 0.633 and 0.635 respectively (p < 0.01). The study confirms the robust relationship between longer working hours and higher emissions, consistent with previous cross-national research. Furthermore, the study finds a composition effect, which had been inconsistently reported in past literature. States with higher total populations and energy production rates exhibit stronger effects, as indicated by respective coefficients and significance levels in the model results (e.g., total population: 0.984** and 0.862**).

The paper argues for the reduction of working hours as a potential climate change mitigation strategy that could yield a "triple dividend": reducing unemployment, enhancing individual quality of life, and lowering environmental impacts. However, it stresses the necessity of accompanying structural changes, such as strengthening welfare and addressing income inequality, to make work time reductions feasible.

The authors note the study's limitations, such as the short time period analyzed and the need for micro-level data to understand the composition effect better. Future research is suggested to explore the impacts of AI and automation on this relationship, and to consider working hour reductions in other sub-national contexts beyond the US.

2026-02-05 09:50:47,664 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input:
Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- Any missing code should be written to replication_data inside the study path.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

**Phases of Execution:**

PHASE 1: BUILD ENVIRONMENT
1. `orchestrator_generate_dockerfile`: Creates _runtime/Dockerfile from replication_info.json.
2. `orchestrator_build_image`: Builds the image.
   * IF BUILD FAILS: Read the error log. It usually means a missing system package or R/Python library. Edit `replication_info.json` to add the missing dependency, regenerate the Dockerfile, and rebuild.

PHASE 2: PREPARE RUNTIME
3. `orchestrator_run_container`: Mounts the code and data and starts the container.
4. `orchestrator_plan` & `orchestrator_preview_entry`: Verify what will run.

PHASE 3: HUMAN APPROVAL (Strict Check)
5. Before running the actual analysis code, you MUST Ask the human:
   Action: ask_human_input: "Ready to execute command: <COMMAND>. Approve? (yes/no)"
   * If they say "no", stop the container and fill the output JSON with status "cancelled".
   * If they say "yes", proceed to Phase 4.

PHASE 4: EXECUTE & DEBUG
6. `orchestrator_execute_entry`: Runs the code.
   * IF EXECUTION FAILS (exit_code != 0): 
     - Read the `stderr` in the observation.
     - Identify if it is a code error or missing library.
     - Use `write_file` to fix the script or `replication_info.json`.
     - If you changed dependencies, you must go back to Phase 1 (Rebuild).
     - If you only changed code, you can retry `orchestrator_execute_entry`.

PHASE 5: FINALIZE
7. `orchestrator_stop_container`: Cleanup.
8. Parse `execution_result.json` and output the Answer in the following required JSON schema.
"{\n  \"execution_summary\": \"A narrative overview of the execution process, including key steps followed, overall success, and alignment with the preregistration (e.g., 'The OLS regression was executed on the 1999 ARIS-REDS dataset, testing the hypothesis on low-caste households.

The goal is to create replication_info.json. 
    
    You will have access to the following documents:
    1. ./data/original/7/python/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. ./data/original/7/python/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. ./data/original/7/python/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
4. ./data/original/7/python/replication_data: The folder containing the data that can potentially be used for the replication. There may also be useful code to help you with the replication. But if not, you have to generate the replication code yourself in Python.

    
    Based on the provided documents, your goal is to plan for the replication study and fill out this JSON template:
    "{\n  \"replication_study\": {\n    \"hypothesis\": \"Focal hypothesis for the replication, phrased as a testable statement at the level of operationalized variables.\",\n    \"study_type\": \"Type of study for the replication (Experimental, Observational, Meta-Analysis, Other); based on the replication dataset.\",\n    \"data_plan\": {\n      \"dataset_identifier\": \" Name/Version.\",\n      \"source_type\": \" Data Source (e.g., survey, database).\",\n      \"wave_or_subset\": \"Specific waves or subsets (if applicable).\",\n      \"sample_size\": \"Sample size of the selected data (if applicable).\",\n      \"unit_of_analysis\": \"Unit of analysis (e.g., individual, household).\",\n      \"access_details\": \"Access details (e.

Question: 
Question: You are interpreting the results of a replication attempt of a research claim.
You are given the following information about the research claim:
1. ./data/original/7/python/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. ./data/original/7/python/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. ./data/original/7/python/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. ./data/original/7/python/replication_info.json: Structured report of the agent at the PLANNING stage for the replication of the given claim.
3. ./data/original/7/python/replication_data: The folder containing the data and code that were used for the replication, along with any output files generated after running the code. You MUST examine any additional execution result files not reported in execution_results.json before making your interpretataions.
4. ./data/original/7/python/execution_results.json: Final structured report of the execution stage by the agent. If the report doesn't have any results, look for output files generated by the code to find the execution results before making conclusions.

Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- Any missing code should be written to replication_data inside the study path.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed

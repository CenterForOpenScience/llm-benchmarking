The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

The paper examines the relationship between working hours and carbon dioxide emissions in the United States from 2007 to 2013, within the context of degrowth strategies and climate change mitigation. The study, conducted by Jared B. Fitzgerald, Juliet B. Schor, and Andrew K. Jorgenson, finds a strong, positive correlation between state-level carbon emissions and average working hours. This association is consistent across various model estimation techniques and remains valid when accounting for political, economic, and demographic factors driving emissions.

Methodology: The study focuses on a sub-national scale, analyzing emissions and working hours data at the state level across all 50 U.S. states. The use of multiple models strengthens the reliability of the findings, while controlling for confounding variables ensures a robust analysis of the direct relationship between working hours and emissions.

Key Metrics and Results:
- There is a strong positive relationship between longer average working hours and higher carbon emissions.
- The scale effect indicates that longer working hours contribute to higher GDP output and subsequently higher emissions.
- The composition effect notes how working hours affect household consumption patterns, which influences emission levels.

Conclusions: The paper suggests that reducing working hours could be an effective policy for climate change mitigation, aligning with the degrowth approach. Such policies might not only mitigate emissions but also improve quality of life and reduce unemployment. Given the federal government's inadequate response to climate change, state-level policies are emphasized as crucial.

Overall, the study supports the argument that working time reduction can contribute to multiple benefits, such as environmental sustainability, better employment conditions, and enhanced wellbeing, especially as states take a more active role in climate leadership amid federal inaction.

The document examines the relationship between economic growth and environmental sustainability, emphasizing the challenges posed by the "rebound effects" or Jevons Paradox, which suggest technology advancements alone cannot achieve sustainability. Research shows minimal evidence of decoupling economic growth from environmental harm, particularly with global pollutants like carbon and methane. Absolute decoupling means emissions stabilize or decline with GDP growth, while relative decoupling means emissions grow slower than GDP, though the latter is deemed insufficient for climate change mitigation.

The paper discusses economic degrowth as an alternative to growth-centric policies, arguing that wealthy nations should reduce economic growth to avoid ecological catastrophes. Scholars propose concepts like steady-state economics, sufficiency, a-growth, and degrowth, aiming for a balance between ecological modernization and the ongoing threat of GDP growth failing to decouple from greenhouse gas emissions. Degrowth advocates suggest systemic changes and reduced production levels to achieve sustainability and equity, providing "ecological space" for developing nations.

Key methodologies in the degrowth paradigm include reductions in working hours to mitigate technologically induced unemployment and address labor displacement due to advancements in AI and automation. The document highlights studies indicating working hour reductions could contribute to ecological benefits, such as lower carbon emissions, through scale and composition effects. The scale effect describes how higher working hours contribute to economic output and consumption, thereby influencing environmental impacts. Conversely, the composition effect posits that households with more leisure time may adopt less ecologically intensive lifestyles.

In conclusion, degrowth emphasizes planned economic contraction and reduced working hours as key policies for social equity and ecological justice while recognizing potential limits and criticisms regarding employment impacts and political feasibility. Working time reduction is considered crucial to navigating the complex interactions between economic growth, employment, and sustainability.

The study examines the relationship between working hours and carbon dioxide emissions at the US state level from 2007 to 2013. Utilizing a balanced panel dataset with 350 observations across all 50 US states, it employs both fixed effects and random effects panel regression models to assess this relationship. Fixed effects models help control for time-invariant factors, providing conservative estimates, while random effects models allow the inclusion of time-invariant factors and utilize both between-case and within-case variation.

Key methodologies include the use of Prais-Winsten models with panel-corrected standard errors for fixed effects and including both state-specific and year-specific intercepts to account for autocorrelation (AR(1) process). In addition, non-binary variables are transformed into logarithmic form to estimate elasticity coefficients.

The key independent variable is the average weekly working hours, derived from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Employment Statistics (CES) database. Louisiana, Texas, and Wyoming registered the highest average working hours, while Hawaii, Wisconsin, and Montana had the lowest during the study period (2007–2013).

The study considers both scale effects and composition effects of working hours on environmental outcomes. Scale effects are assessed by disaggregating GDP into working hours, labor productivity, and employment to population ratio. Composition effects are measured controlling for GDP. Additional control variables include population size, manufacturing as a percentage of GDP, energy production, working-age population percentage, and average household size.

The results suggest that reducing working hours can positively impact carbon emissions by decreasing energy consumption. Notably, scenarios reducing working hours could lead to reduced emissions, potentially offering a "triple dividend": lower unemployment, enhanced quality of life, and reduced environmental pressures. This aligns with prior findings at the national level indicating increased energy consumption correlates with longer working hours.

This analysis highlights the potential for policy-driven reductions in working hours as a means to mitigate carbon emissions across US states, suggesting economic structures and social norms might need to adapt to incorporate these environmental and social benefits.

The research evaluates the relationship between working hours and carbon emissions across U.S. states using data from 2007 to 2013. Various models explore the scale and composition effects of working hours on emissions, examining factors like GDP, energy production, and state environmentalism.

Key Findings:
1. **Scale Effect:** Models 1 and 3 indicate a significant positive relationship between increased working hours and carbon emissions. A 1% rise in working hours corresponds to a 0.668% and 0.654% increase in emissions for fixed and random effects models, respectively.
2. **Composition Effect:** Models 2 and 4 also find a positive impact where a 1% rise in working hours is associated with a 0.675% and 0.552% increase in emissions, respectively.
3. **Population and Energy Production:** Both effects are significantly positive in all models, suggesting they're major contributors to emissions.
4. **State Environmentalism:** This measure is negatively significant in its effect on emissions, showing a decrease in emissions with higher state environmentalism.
5. **Regional Variation:** Midwest and South regions displayed higher emissions, indicating regional disparities.

Methodology:
- Data are drawn from environmental voting scores from the League of Conservation Voters from 1990 to 2005, used to create invariant scores for a 15-year period.
- The models use Prais-Winsten regression with AR(1) correction, looking at both fixed and random effects.
- Sensitivity analyses showed consistent findings, including "hybrid" models to verify robust results.

Conclusion:
The study suggests a need for planned economic contraction or degrowth to manage emissions better. While models consistently show working hours as a driver of emissions, regional and state-specific variables also play crucial roles. The conclusions advocate for considering these factors in policy-making to address climate change more effectively.

The study investigates the relationship between state-level working hours and carbon emissions across the 50 US states, emphasizing the importance of sub-national actions in addressing climate change due to inadequate federal policies. Using a hybrid modeling approach applied to data from 2007-2013, the researchers found that increased working hours are associated with higher carbon emissions at the state level. The analysis focuses on both scale and composition effects, revealing that longer work hours contribute to increased emissions through GDP contributions and lead to more carbon-intensive lifestyles.

Key metrics analyzed include working hours, employed population percentage, GDP per hour and per capita, total population, and manufacturing's share of GDP. The results show significant positive associations between working hours and emissions, even when controlling for these factors, indicating that longer work hours likely result in more carbon-intensive lifestyles due to less time affluence. Specific findings include:
- Working hours are positively linked to carbon emissions, with coefficients of 0.633** and 0.635** in the scale and composition hybrid models, respectively, demonstrating statistical significance.
- Employed population percentage and energy production also significantly affected emissions.
- The study points out challenges and benefits of working time reductions, suggesting that voluntary reductions could spread employment, decrease stress, improve quality of life, and reduce environmental impacts.

The paper concludes that reducing working time has socio-environmental benefits and offers a “triple dividend”: spreading employment, enhancing individual well-being, and reducing environmental impact. However, it acknowledges challenges due to structural barriers, such as the lack of a strong welfare state and income inequality. The study emphasizes that future research should explore the effects of automation and AI on employment and emissions, and extend the analysis beyond 2007-2013 to understand temporal changes in these dynamics.

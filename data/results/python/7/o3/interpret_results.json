  "interpretation_summary": "The replication study was unable to produce any substantive statistical output. The execution phase repeatedly failed because the Python rewrite of the original R analysis could not locate the mounted data inside the Docker container and subsequently crashed (File-not-found and segmentation-fault errors). Multiple ad-hoc edits were made to the replication script, including switching from the preregistered PanelOLS approach to an ordinary least-squares model with dummy variables, but none of the edited versions ran successfully to completion. Consequently, no coefficient for average weekly working hours was estimated and no comparison with the original paper\u2019s elasticity (\u22480.55\u20130.67) is possible. Overall, the replication attempt did not reach the stage of generating results, so the hypothesis could not be tested.",

Although the preregistration called for a fixed-effects panel regression with clustered standard errors, the implemented code underwent multiple unplanned revisions, ultimately switching to statsmodels OLS with dummies (still unfinished).

      "summary": "Across all model specifications, longer average working hours are significantly associated with higher carbon dioxide emissions at the U.S. state level. Elasticity estimates indicate that a 1 % increase in working hours is linked to roughly a 0.55\u20130.68 % increase in emissions after adjusting for key covariates. These findings remain robust across fixed-effects, random-effects, and hybrid models, underscoring the environmental benefits that could arise from working-time reductions.",

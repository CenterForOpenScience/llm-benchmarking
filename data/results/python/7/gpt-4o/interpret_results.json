  "interpretation_summary": "The replication study aimed to test the hypothesis that average working hours per worker in a state are positively associated with carbon emissions. The replication process involved setting up a Python 3.10 environment and executing a modified script to align with the dataset's structure. Despite successful execution, the replication did not support the original hypothesis, as the coefficient for working hours was not statistically significant and had a negative direction.",
  "execute_status": "Success",
  "fidelity_assessment": {
    "method_alignment": "Partial alignment: The replication used PanelOLS regression models with entity and time effects, similar to the original study's panel regression approach. However, deviations occurred due to dataset structure differences and model formula adjustments.",

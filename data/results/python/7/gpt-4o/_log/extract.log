The study "US Working Hours and Carbon Dioxide Emissions" by Jared B. Fitzgerald, Juliet B. Schor, and Andrew K. Jorgenson examines the relationship between state-level carbon emissions and average working hours in the United States from 2007 to 2013. It highlights that there is a significant positive correlation between the two, indicating that as working hours increase, carbon emissions also rise. This relationship remains consistent across various model estimation techniques and is adjusted for political, economic, and demographic influences.

Key methodologies included analyzing carbon emissions data and average weekly working hours across all 50 states. The authors utilized various econometric models to ensure robustness in their findings. The period of analysis, 2007-2013, was selected to capture fluctuations during a time of notable state-level climate initiatives amid federal inaction.

Results demonstrate that working time reduction could serve as a dual benefit policy: it aids in mitigating emissions while simultaneously enhancing quality of life and protecting employment. The findings suggest that state-level policies may gain more relevance due to the lack of comprehensive federal climate action, especially following the federal shift towards supporting fossil fuel consumption.

The conclusions drawn emphasize the need for innovative state-level policies that encourage working time reductions as a strategic approach to climate change mitigation. This aligns with the ongoing debate on the economic implications of reduced working hours and their potential to slow GDP growth, which in turn could lessen greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, the study advocates for a reassessment of both economic and environmental strategies at the state level, especially in light of advancements in automation and shifting workforce dynamics.

The paper addresses the complex interplay between economic growth, technological advancements, and environmental sustainability, arguing against the feasibility of achieving sustainability within a growth-centric society. Key methodologies encompass a review of sociological research on economic growth and carbon emissions, critiquing the concepts of "relative" versus "absolute" decoupling in relation to sustainable development. While relative decoupling refers to a slower growth in environmental harm than economic output, absolute decoupling implies a reduction or stabilization of harm alongside economic growth, which is necessary in combatting climate change. 

The findings of various studies indicate limited support for decoupling growth from environmental harm on a macro scale, especially concerning global pollutants like carbon and methane emissions. Thus, there is a call from scholars for a pivot away from growth-centric policies, echoing the "limits to growth" discussions of the 1970s. This broader discourse fosters concepts such as steady-state economics, sufficiency, a-growth, and degrowth, which advocate for constraining economic growth to mitigate ecological damage.

Advocates of degrowth argue for planned reductions in production to ensure ecological sustainability and global equity, particularly suggesting that wealthy nations should decrease consumption to provide “ecological space” for developing countries. Although some purport that this stance might lack political viability or sufficient critique of capitalism, they view it as a potential vehicle for systemic transition towards equitable and ecologically sound economic practices.

A significant aspect of the degrowth argument includes the reduction of working hours as a response to potential unemployment due to economic contraction and automation. Historically, GDP growth and reductions in working hours have acted to alleviate unemployment; however, degrowth scenarios may preclude the former. Consequently, scholars suggest that reduced working hours can help distribute labor more equitably and improve ecological outcomes through decreased consumption.

The paper summarizes that while the relationship between economic growth and human well-being, particularly in affluent societies, is complex and debated, evidence suggests diminishing returns on well-being beyond certain income levels. This leads to the notion of "uneconomic growth" where the social and environmental costs of growth outweigh its benefits.

In conclusion, the document presents a case for systemic change in economic thinking and policy, emphasizing the necessity for reduced working hours alongside a broader societal shift towards degrowth to ensure environmental sustainability and social equity.

The study investigates the relationship between working hours and carbon dioxide emissions at the state level in the United States from 2007 to 2013. This analysis builds on earlier research, which found a positive correlation between working hours and ecological footprints in various contexts, with key findings suggesting that reducing working hours can lead to decreased energy consumption and carbon emissions.

Key methodologies employed in this study include:

1. **Data Collection**: A balanced panel dataset consisting of annual state-level observations for all 50 US states was used, resulting in a total of 350 observations covering the years 2007–2013. Key data sources include the US Environmental Protection Agency (for carbon emissions) and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (for working hours).

2. **Model Estimation**: The researchers utilized both fixed effects and random effects panel regression models to explore the relationship between working hours and carbon dioxide emissions. Specific methodologies include:
   - **Prais-Winsten models with panel corrected standard errors (PCSEs)** for fixed effects, allowing for common AR(1) corrections for first-order autocorrelation.
   - **Random effects models** that include time-invariant factors, improving data efficiency.

3. **Variable Transformations**: Non-binary variables were transformed into logarithmic form to enable estimation of elasticity coefficients, representing net percent changes in emissions associated with percentage changes in working hours.

4. **Dependent Variable**: Carbon dioxide emissions measured in million metric tons (MMTCO2) from fossil fuel combustion, which constitutes over 75% of total emissions, served as the dependent variable.

5. **Independent Variables**: The key independent variable was average weekly working hours per worker, obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Variations in average working hours were noted, with Texas having the highest at 36.2 hours and Hawaii the lowest at 32.9 hours during the study period. 

Results indicated a clear positive correlation between working hours and carbon dioxide emissions, consistent with earlier findings. Moreover, additional factors influencing emissions were also examined, including GDP's components (working hours, labor productivity, employed population ratio), state population size, energy production, and environmentalism measures.

The study concludes that reducing working hours could lead to significant environmental benefits, highlighting the potential for legislative changes at the state level to address climate change. It suggests a triple dividend effect of reduced working hours—lower unemployment, enhanced quality of life, and diminished environmental pressures. Ultimately, the authors advocate for more extensive analysis, particularly in light of identified thresholds beyond which reductions in hours may cease to correlate with further reductions in emissions.

The paper analyzes the relationship between average working hours and carbon emissions across all 50 U.S. states from 2007 to 2013 using congressional voting scores on environmental issues as a measure of state environmentalism. The scores, sourced from the League of Conservation Voters, cover data from 1990 to 2005, and although time-invariant, they are integral for assessing regional variations in carbon emissions.

**Methodologies:**
- **Data Analysis**: Utilizes time-invariant scores of environmental voting, dummy variables for census regions, descriptive statistics, and bivariate correlations.
- **Panel Regression Analysis**: Implemented using both fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models to examine both scale and composition effects of working hours on carbon emissions.
- **Robustness Checks**: Conducted hybrid models combining FE and RE, sensitivity analyses excluding outlier states, and additional models controlling for education levels.

**Specific Metrics:**
- **Correlation Between Working Hours and Emissions**: A positive correlation coefficient of 0.464 was found between the percent change in working hours and the percent change in carbon emissions during the study period.
- **Regression Results**:
  - **Model 1 (Scale-FE)**: A 1% increase in working hours correlates with a 0.668% increase in emissions.
  - **Model 2 (Comp-FE)**: A 1% increase in working hours correlates with a 0.675% increase, holding all else constant.
  - **Model 3 (Scale-RE)**: A similar finding where a 1% increase results in a 0.654% increase in emissions.
  - **Model 4 (Comp-RE)**: There is a reported 0.552% increase in emissions for a 1% increase in working hours.

**Notable Findings**:
- Total population and energy production are consistently significant positive predictors of carbon emissions.
- The measure of state environmentalism showed a significant negative association with carbon emissions in models accounting for scale and composition effects.
- Regional dummy variables indicated significant differences in emissions, particularly for the Midwest and South.

**Conclusions**:
The study highlights that increasing working hours contribute positively to carbon emissions, suggesting a potential need for policy adjustments focusing on working hours to mitigate emissions. The research aligns with calls for degrowth—planned economic contraction—as a viable strategy to reach climate targets and avert severe climate change impacts. The findings indicate the importance of considering both economic activity and demographic factors, such as population size and state environmental policies, in discussions about sustainability and emissions reductions.

The study examines the relationship between state-level working hours and carbon emissions across all 50 US states, addressing a critical environmental issue given slow federal climate action. This analysis is significant as states have pursued their emission reduction strategies in light of changing political climates. Findings indicate a positive association between working hours and carbon emissions, highlighting both scale and composition effects.

**Key Methodologies:**
- Analyzed state-level data from 2007 to 2013.
- Created Hybrid Regression Models to assess the impact of average hours worked per week on CO2 emissions.
- Controlled for confounding variables such as GDP, population, and energy production.

**Specific Metrics:**
- Model results reveal that for each additional hour worked, carbon emissions increase significantly; working hours have coefficients of 0.633 (Scale) and 0.635 (Composition) with a p-value < 0.01.
- Employment ratio, energy production, and geographic location also influenced results, with the Midwest exhibiting significant higher emissions contributions.

**Results:**
- Longer working hours correlate with increased CO2 emissions, suggesting both a scale effect where economic production increases emissions and a composition effect where lifestyle patterns shift during increased work hours.
- Notably, evidence showed the potential for a “triple dividend” from reducing working hours which includes spreading employment, enhancing individual well-being, and lowering carbon emissions.

**Conclusions:**
- Reducing working hours is proposed as an effective climate change mitigation strategy.
- There are inherent social and economic challenges tied to involuntary working time reductions, highlighting the need for voluntary programs to encourage change without leading to job loss.
- Structural reforms such as reducing income inequality and bolstering healthcare access are vital for making working time reductions feasible.
- The analysis has limitations, including a restricted time frame and the need for household-level data to enhance understanding of the effects of working hours on emissions at a micro-level. Future research should also consider the impact of automation and AI.

Overall, the study posits that changes in working hours could be a crucial factor in improving environmental outcomes while addressing social and economic dynamics in the US.

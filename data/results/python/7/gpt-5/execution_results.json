  "execution_summary": "We translated the provided R script (panelAR models) into Python (pandas + linearmodels PanelOLS with entity and time fixed effects, clustered SE by state). We created replication_info.json to use a Python entrypoint, generated and amended the Dockerfile to install dependencies, built the image, ran a container, and executed the analysis after explicit approval. The run initially failed due to Python 3.9 type annotation (PEP 604) and Stata categorical conversion issues, which were fixed by adjusting type hints (Optional) and disabling categorical conversion in pd.read_stata. The final execution succeeded and produced model summaries and coefficients under replication_data/artifacts. The core hypothesis tested is that average working hours per worker is positively associated with CO2 emissions; the replication finds positive coefficients for wrkhrs across specifications, with statistical significance varying by subset.",

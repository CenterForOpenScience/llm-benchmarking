      "description": "The study analyzes a balanced panel of all 50 U.S. states (2007\u20132013) to estimate the association between average weekly working hours and state-level CO2 emissions. It employs panel regression models (fixed effects, random effects, two-way fixed effects) using Prais\u2013Winsten estimation with panel-corrected standard errors and AR(1) structure. Hybrid models decompose within- and between-state effects. Controls include demographic, economic, energy, and regional factors, with robustness checks and sensitivity analyses.",

        "Fit fixed effects (including two-way FE with state and year intercepts) and random effects models; include census region indicators where time-invariant variables are modeled.",
        "Estimate hybrid models with unit-specific means and deviations to parse within- and between-state variation.",

      "summary": "Across multiple panel specifications, average weekly working hours are positively and significantly associated with state-level CO2 emissions. Estimated elasticities indicate that a 1% increase in working hours is associated with approximately 0.55\u20130.68% higher emissions. Control variables such as population size and energy production are positive and significant; GDP per capita is generally non-significant; state environmentalism is negative and significant. Results are robust to hybrid models, regional controls, and sensitivity analyses.",

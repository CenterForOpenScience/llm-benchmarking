  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed the preregistered WLS models on GEM country\u2013year data, testing the negative association between median age and entrepreneurship. Results: (1) 2010 cross-section shows a significant negative coefficient with a scaled 1 SD effect of about +3.80 pp (larger than the original 2.5 pp); (2) 2001\u20132010 panel with year FE yields a scaled effect of +2.45 pp, closely matching the original 2.5 pp; (3) adding country FE attenuates the effect to +0.63 pp and renders it insignificant. Overall, the preregistered year-FE panel aligns closely with the original claim; cross-section overestimates; country+year FE does not replicate the magnitude/significance.",

Direction: negative association between median age and entrepreneurship.",
    "replication_results": "2010 cross-section (WLS, HC1): beta_median_age = -0.01123 (SE = 0.00243, p = 3.74e-06), scaled effect (1 SD decrease) = +3.795 pp [2.187, 5.403].

    "overall_answer": "Yes for the preregistered year-FE panel (effect \u2248 +2.45 pp, significant and directionally consistent with the original 2.5 pp). Cross-section is consistent in sign but larger in magnitude (~3.8 pp). The country+year FE specification does not meet the magnitude/significance criterion.

      "suggestions": "Augment the dataset with macro controls used in the original robustness checks (GDP per capita, startup costs, property rights, etc.) to test whether the effect persists with additional covariates; explicitly predefine the SD (e.g., fix at 3.5 years) for comparability with the headline statement."
    }
  ],
  "notes": "The scaled effect is sensitive to the SD used; this replication computed SD=3.38 years from the 2010 sample. The country+year FE result suggests the headline demographic effect is largely cross-country; when within-country variation is isolated, the effect weakens. Future work could explore alternative weighting schemes, additional controls, and matching the exact country set as in 2010 to refine magnitude comparability."

    "hypothesis": "In country-year data from GEM, a one standard deviation decrease in the country\u2019s median age (computed for ages 20\u201364) is associated with an increase in the entrepreneurship rate (share owning/managing a business up to 42 months old and paying wages), around 2.5 percentage points circa 2010; formally, the entrepreneurship rate is negatively associated with median age.",

It is directly suitable to replicate the country-year regressions relating entrepreneurship rates to median age and to compute the 1 SD effect in 2010.",

The provided data dictionary (liang_mkk9_dictionary.tsv) confirms entrepreneurship is constructed from GEM\u2019s BABYBUSO item and median_age is computed for ages 20\u201364 from IDB. The post_registration.json cites the same concept and period (GEM 2001\u20132010).",
        "deviation_from_original": "The provided dataset includes years beyond 2010 (up to 2016 per get_dataset_description and the dictionary), whereas the original focal analysis and headline claim emphasize the 2010 cross-section and 2001\u20132010 panel (post_registration.json, original_paper.pdf summary). Our panel analyses restrict to 2001\u20132010 to match the original, but the file\u2019s extended coverage represents a larger sample than used in the original. Some macro controls used in the original (GDP per capita, startup costs, etc.) are not present in this replication file; thus, the core replication here targets the reduced-form specification with median age plus fixed effects and weights, focusing on the focal median-age effect, not all robustness controls."

The entrepreneurship measure appears to be based on ages 20\u201364 (per dictionary). Observations are to be weighted by cy_cell (per Table 2 note cited in the dictionary). The 2010 mean entrepreneurship rate and SD of median age are computed from the dataset and used to construct scaled effects comparable to the paper\u2019s 2.5 percentage points statement."

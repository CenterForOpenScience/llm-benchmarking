  "execution_summary": "We generated the Dockerfile from replication_info.json, built the image (retagged to replication-exec per runtime expectation), started the container, and planned to run the Python entrypoint. Before execution, we created a root-level Python wrapper (replicate_mkk9.py) to call the analysis module in replication_data. The first run failed due to statsmodels receiving object dtype data and also due to an earlier duplicated function signature introduced in editing. We fixed the script by enforcing numeric dtypes for design matrices, adding robust NA handling, and removing duplicated function definitions. The second execution completed successfully. The analysis ran WLS regressions on the GEM-based country-year dataset: (1) 2010 cross-section WLS with HC1 standard errors, (2) 2001\u20132010 panel with year fixed effects (clustered by country), and (3) 2001\u20132010 panel with country and year fixed effects (clustered by country). Outputs were saved to /app/data/replication_summary_mkk9.json and /app/data/replication_results_mkk9.json. The focal hypothesis was supported in the cross-section and year-FE panel; the country+year FE panel attenuated the effect and became statistically insignificant, which we report faithfully.",

      "description": "The study combines a demographic-theory model (rank effect and advantages of youth vs. business acumen) with empirical analysis using GEM and FESE. It estimates reduced-form regressions at country-year and country\u2013age group levels, relating entrepreneurship rates to demographic structure (median age and a population shrinkage parameter r), the share of younger population (s_a), age and age-squared, and macro controls. Country fixed effects and multiple definitions of entrepreneurship are used for robustness. Theoretical propositions predict lower entrepreneurship in older societies and an inverted U-shaped relationship between age and entrepreneurship, peaking in middle age.",

    "results": {
      "summary": "Entrepreneurship declines with population aging: a one standard deviation lower median age is associated with a 2.5 percentage point higher new business formation rate (about 40% of the mean). Older societies have lower entrepreneurship at every age, consistent with a rank effect where younger workers in older populations gain skills more slowly. Within countries, entrepreneurship follows an inverted U-shape over age, peaking in the early 30s (around 32), and middle-aged groups are most sensitive to demographic aging. The demographic parameter r is negatively associated with entrepreneurship in both full and OECD samples, robust to controls and alternative outcome definitions. Model-based comparisons imply substantially higher entrepreneurship in younger countries (e.g., predicted U.S. rate 61% higher than Japan).",

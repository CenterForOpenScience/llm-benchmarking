  "interpretation_summary": "The replication successfully tested the hypothesis that the entrepreneurship rate is negatively associated with a country's median age. The WLS regression on the replication dataset supported the hypothesis with a negative coefficient for median age, consistent with the original study's findings on the influence of age structure on entrepreneurship rates.",

    "original_results": "Younger countries exhibit higher rates of entrepreneurship. A one standard deviation decrease in median age increases entrepreneurship rates by 2.5 percentage points.",
    "replication_results": "Coefficient for median_age: -0.0077, SE: 0.000, p<0.000, indicating a significant negative association.",

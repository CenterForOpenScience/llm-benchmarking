  "execution_summary": "We generated the Dockerfile from replication_info.json, built the Python 3.10 image with pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, and pyreadstat, and started the container. The declared entrypoint was missing, so we created a Python translation of the Stata script (replicate_median_age_effect__py.py) to run entrepreneurship ~ median_age + year fixed effects with analytic weights (cy_cell) and country-clustered SEs. On first execution, the code failed due to a hardcoded data path; we updated the script to locate the CSV robustly under /app/data. On second execution, it failed due to pandas' nullable Int64 dtype for year; we fixed the dtype handling. The final run completed successfully, producing a significantly negative coefficient on median_age, consistent with the preregistered hypothesis. Outputs (summary, tidy results, extras) were saved in /app/data.",

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed a WLS regression of entrepreneurship on median age with year fixed effects, analytic weights, and country-clustered SEs, as preregistered. After resolving minor execution issues (file path and dtype for year), the model ran successfully and produced a significantly negative coefficient on median_age. The replicated magnitude implies about a 2.68 percentage point increase in entrepreneurship for a one SD decrease (\u22483.5 years), closely matching the original\u2019s 2.5 pp benchmark and well within a similar range. Overall, the replication supports the original claim with high methodological fidelity and comparable effect size.",

    "method_alignment": "High alignment: The executed code estimated entrepreneurship ~ median_age + year fixed effects using analytic weights (cy_cell) and country-clustered robust SEs, matching the preregistered plan and mirroring the referenced Stata specification. The focus remained on the median_age specification without adding broader macro controls, consistent with the plan.",

  ],
  "notes": "The 3.5-year SD pertains to 2010; the replication spans multiple years. Using a per-year coefficient and scaling by 3.5 is a reasonable comparison to the original benchmark. Some divergence could arise from sample composition and absence of macro controls, but the replicated effect\u2019s sign, significance, and magnitude are highly consistent. Consider sensitivity checks with alternative weighting or fixed effects if replicating broader original analyses."

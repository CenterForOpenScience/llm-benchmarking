      "description": "The study develops a theoretical model linking demographic age structure to entrepreneurship (rank effect) and tests its predictions using cross-country panel regressions based on GEM (and FESE) survey data combined with demographic statistics from the IDB. Empirical analyses regress country(-age)-year entrepreneurship rates on demographic measures (median age, cohort shrinkage parameter r, share younger than a), include standard macro controls, use year dummies, cluster standard errors at the country level, and perform robustness checks across definitions of entrepreneurship and OECD vs. non-OECD samples.",

      "summary": "Younger demographic structures are associated with higher entrepreneurship rates. A one standard deviation decrease in median age corresponds to a 2.5 percentage point increase in business formation (about 40% of the mean rate). The demographic structure parameter r is strongly negatively related to entrepreneurship (e.g., coefficient around \u22122.041, p < 0.001). Entrepreneurship exhibits an inverted-U relationship with age, peaking in the early 30s. These patterns are robust across alternative entrepreneurship definitions, OECD vs. non-OECD samples, and complementary FESE data. Predicted rates illustrate sizable cross-country differences linked to age structure (e.g., Japan vs. U.S.).",

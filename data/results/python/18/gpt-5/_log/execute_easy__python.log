2026-01-13 03:56:18,530 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

**Phases of Execution:**

PHASE 1: BUILD ENVIRONMENT
1. `orchestrator_generate_dockerfile`: Creates _runtime/Dockerfile from replication_info.json.
2. `orchestrator_build_image`: Builds the image.
   * IF BUILD FAILS: Read the error log. It usually means a missing system package or R/Python library. Edit `replication_info.json` to add the missing dependency, regenerate the Dockerfile, and rebuild.

PHASE 2: PREPARE RUNTIME
3. `orchestrator_run_container`: Mounts the code and data and starts the container.
4. `orchestrator_plan` & `orchestrator_preview_entry`: Verify what will run.

PHASE 3: HUMAN APPROVAL (Strict Check)
5. Before running the actual analysis code, you MUST Ask the human:
   Action: ask_human_input: "Ready to execute command: <COMMAND>. Approve? (yes/no)"
   * If they say "no", stop the container and fill the output JSON with status "cancelled".
   * If they say "yes", proceed to Phase 4.

PHASE 4: EXECUTE & DEBUG
6. `orchestrator_execute_entry`: Runs the code.
   * IF EXECUTION FAILS (exit_code != 0): 
     - Read the `stderr` in the observation.
     - Identify if it is a code error or missing library.
     - Use `write_file` to fix the script or `replication_info.json`.
     - If you changed dependencies, you must go back to Phase 1 (Rebuild).
     - If you only changed code, you can retry `orchestrator_execute_entry`.

PHASE 5: FINALIZE
7. `orchestrator_stop_container`: Cleanup.
8. Parse `execution_result.json` and output the Answer in the following required JSON schema.

Thought: The entrypoint file is missing. I inspected the Stata .do and the CSV to confirm variable names. I will now create a Python entrypoint that replicates the Stata model: entrepreneurship ~ median_age + year fixed effects, weighted by cy_cell, with country-clustered SEs. The script will read from /app/data/original/18/0112_gpt5_2/replication_data/replication_data_mkk9.csv and save outputs under /app/data. After creating it, I will retry preview and proceed to human approval.

Thought: The container execution failed because statsmodels/formula with C(year) could not handle pandas' nullable Int64 dtype. I will modify the script to:
- Avoid using the pandas "Int64" nullable dtype for year.
- After dropping NAs, cast year to standard int.

Then I will rerun the analysis.

Thought: The failure was due to pandas' nullable Int64 dtype for the year variable causing issues with statsmodels. I modified the script to avoid using the nullable Int64 and instead keep year as a standard numeric type. I will now retry the execution.

Thought: I followed the required phases: generated Dockerfile, built the image, started the container, identified a missing Python entrypoint, created a Python translation of the Stata .do file, previewed the entry, obtained human approval, executed, debugged two issues (dataset path and pandas Int64 dtype), and re-executed successfully. Below is the complete execution report and results.

Answer: {
  "execution_summary": "We generated the Dockerfile from replication_info.json, built the Python 3.10 image with pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, and pyreadstat, and started the container. The declared entrypoint was missing, so we created a Python translation of the Stata script (replicate_median_age_effect__py.py) to run entrepreneurship ~ median_age + year fixed effects with analytic weights (cy_cell) and country-clustered SEs. On first execution, the code failed due to a hardcoded data path; we updated the script to locate the CSV robustly under /app/data. On second execution, it failed due to pandas' nullable Int64 dtype for year; we fixed the dtype handling. The final run completed successfully, producing a significantly negative coefficient on median_age, consistent with the preregistered hypothesis. Outputs (summary, tidy results, extras) were saved in /app/data.",

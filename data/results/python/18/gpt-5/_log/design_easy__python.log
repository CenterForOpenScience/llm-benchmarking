    First, determine whether the provided data can be used for replicating the provided focal claim. 
    - Ensure that all necessary variables are available.
    - Ensure that the data qualify for replication criteria. Replication data achieves its purpose by being different data collected under similar/identical conditions, thus testing if the phenomenon is robust across independent instances.
    
    If you find issues with the provided data, follow-up with a human supervisor to ask for a different data source until appropriate data is given.
    
    Once you have determined the provided data are good for replication, explore the code to help fill out fields related to the codebase. This code will operate directly on the data files given to you.
    Find potential issues with the provided code such as a data file path that is different from the data files you have looked at.
    - If the code reads any data file, the file path must be in this directory "/app/data".
    - If the code dumps content or produce additional content, the file must also be in this directory "/app/data".
    
    RUN POLICY (DESIGN)
- Translate every non-Python analysis script (.R/.do/etc.) into Python. Any necessary translation must be performed using necessary tools BEFORE filling out the given JSON template.
- Keep originals unchanged; write new files like: <basename>__py.py
- Ensure all IO uses /app/data.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code so that it is compatible. 
- Set the executed entrypoint to the Python rewrite (or a Python wrapper that runs the translated scripts in order).
- Preserve logic, outputs, and seeds as closely as possible.
- Make sure that replication_info.json reflects the change. All docker related information must also be compatible with Python execution.

    If your code reads in any data file, ASSUME that the data will be in this directory: "/app/data".
    If you code produce any additional files, the code must save the files in this directory: "/app/data".

    File operations policy:
    - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
    - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
    - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.
    
    All critical code issues must be resolved as a part of planning. After that, finish by filling out the required JSON with all the updated/final information to prepare for replication execution.
    Rememeber, every response needs to have the the following one of the two formats:

Thought: I will:
1) Inspect initial_details.txt to understand the focal claim for replication.
2) Read post_registration.json for structured details about variables, model, and original data.
3) Skim original_paper.pdf for methodology and variables to ensure alignment.
4) Inspect the replication_data folder structure and files, and load datasets to verify variable availability and suitability.
5) If non-Python analysis code is present, plan translation to Python and ensure all IO paths are /app/data.
6) Based on findings, compose the replication plan and fill replication_info.json.

2026-01-13 03:26:17,747 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Observation: [CLAIM]
A  one standard deviation decrease in median age (equal to 3.5 years in 2010) results in a 2.5 percentage point increase in the entrepreneurship rate, which is over 40 percent of the mean entrepreneurship rate across countries (equal to 0.061 in 2010).

[HYPOTHESIS]
The entrepreneurship rate in a country is negatively associated with the country’s median age.
2026-01-13 03:26:27,735 - replication - INFO - ***Agent output:
Thought: I have the focal claim and hypothesis. Next, I will read post_registration.json to extract structured details about variables, model, and original data. Then I will skim the original PDF for methodology and operationalization details. I will inspect the replication_data folder to see available datasets and verify if variables needed (entrepreneurship rate, median age, country-year identifiers, and potential controls) are present. If datasets are present, I will load them to check columns and sample sizes. Based on this, I will draft the replication plan and fill out replication_info.json, ensuring any code paths use /app/data and planning Python execution.

The provided .do script REPEntireDataset2_Country_Year_Entre_Regression.do runs: reg entrepreneurship median_age i.year [aw=cy_cell], cluster(country) on replication_data_mkk9.csv, directly mirroring the original specification (post_registration.json method/models).",
        "deviation_from_original": "The replication focuses on the median_age specification without the broader macro controls listed in post_registration.json (e.g., log GDP per capita, startup costs). Also, the dataset is a prepared CSV rather than raw GEM/IDB merges, so variable definitions rely on preprocessing embedded upstream. This makes it an independent compiled sample rather than the full multi-source reconstruction."
      },
      "notes": "The .do script drops rows with median_age == \"NA\" then destrings; we will implement equivalent cleaning in Python (filter non-numeric/NA median_age, cast to float). The .do uses analytic weights cy_cell, year fixed effects i.year, and clusters by country. We will reproduce these via statsmodels WLS with robust covariance clustered at country and year dummies. All paths will use /app/data. If any of the required columns (entrepreneurship, median_age, country, year, cy_cell) are missing or differently named, we will map to the correct names or request a corrected dataset."

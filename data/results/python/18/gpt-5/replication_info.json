        "explanation": "The CSV includes the necessary operational variables used in the original study\u2019s reduced-form specification as evidenced by the paired Stata .do script: entrepreneurship rate (dependent), median_age (key predictor), year fixed effects, and country identifiers with analytic weights. This enables a direct test of the focal claim using independent compiled data consistent with original sources.",
        "similarity_to_original": "Per post_registration.json, the original used GEM country-year entrepreneurship rates and demographic measures including median age with year dummies and country-clustered SEs. The provided .do script REPEntireDataset2_Country_Year_Entre_Regression.do runs: reg entrepreneurship median_age i.year [aw=cy_cell], cluster(country) on replication_data_mkk9.csv, directly mirroring the original specification (post_registration.json method/models).",
        "deviation_from_original": "The replication focuses on the median_age specification without the broader macro controls listed in post_registration.json (e.g., log GDP per capita, startup costs). Also, the dataset is a prepared CSV rather than raw GEM/IDB merges, so variable definitions rely on preprocessing embedded upstream. This makes it an independent compiled sample rather than the full multi-source reconstruction."
      },
      "notes": "The .do script drops rows with median_age == \"NA\" then destrings; we will implement equivalent cleaning in Python (filter non-numeric/NA median_age, cast to float). The .do uses analytic weights cy_cell, year fixed effects i.year, and clusters by country. We will reproduce these via statsmodels WLS with robust covariance clustered at country and year dummies. All paths will use /app/data. If any of the required columns (entrepreneurship, median_age, country, year, cy_cell) are missing or differently named, we will map to the correct names or request a corrected dataset."

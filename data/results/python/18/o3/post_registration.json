A one-standard-deviation decrease in median age raises the new-business formation rate by about 2.5 percentage points\u2014roughly 40 % of the mean rate. The negative effect of aging holds within every age group, is strongest for middle-aged cohorts, and is robust to alternative definitions, subsamples, and datasets (FESE).",

You are a researcher specialized in evaluating research replication studies.
You are given a JSON object containing structured report of a replication attempt of a research paper and a reference document that contains outcomes/information if the replication study is to carried out correctly. your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the reported JSON object based on the information presented in the reference document.

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the "fidelity_assessment" and "results_comparisons" aspects: 
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in "interpretation_summary" and "execute_status":
An interger from 0 to 3 based on the quality regarding status and report completeness of the replication study.

Replication of a research claim from Liang et al. (2018) in the Journal 
of Political Economy 
 
SCORE Report - Liang_JournPoliEco_2018_q8xv_mkk9 
 
Nathan Fiala 
Victor Volkman 
 
Claim Summary 
The claim selected from for replication Liang et al. (2018) is that the number of entrepreneurs as 
a fraction of the workforce decreases with the country’s median age. This reflects the following 
statement from the paper's abstract: "A one standard deviation decrease in a country’s median 
age increases new business formation by 2.5 percentage points, which is about 40 percent of 
the mean rate." [Tested with] country-Year-Level entrepreneurship rate regression. Table 2 
reports reduced-form regressions at the country level of aggregation. Portion of Table 2 
selected is Column 3. Focal independent variable is “Median age (ages 20-64)”. [Coefficient of 
“Median age (ages 20-64)” is -0.007 with standard errors clustered at the country level of -
0.001, significant at 1 percent.] Using the estimates from column 3 of table 2, a one standard 
deviation decrease in median age (equal to 3.5 years in 2010) results in a 2.5 percentage point 
increase in the entrepreneurship rate, which is over 40 percent of the mean entrepreneurship 
rate across countries (equal to 0.061 in 2010). 
 
Replication Criteria 
A successful replication of the key SCORE test (H*) would be to confirm that the 
entrepreneurship rate in a country is negatively associated with the country’s median age after 
expanding the years of the data set. 
 
Replication Result 
The analysis in the original study relied on data from two sources: the Global Entrepreneurship 
Monitor (GEM) and the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Database, with a sample period of 
2001-2010. This analysis uses the same data and expands the time period to be 2001-2016. 
This data is publicly available.  

 
 
We find that the results are robust to the inclusion of the additional years of data. The 
relationship between the entrepreneurship level of a country and the median age of the citizens 
in the original study (data covering 2001 to 2010) was found to be -0.0074 (p-value 0.0000, CI: 
[-0.0101, -0.0047]). The relationship in the new data (2011 to 2016) is -0.0079 (p-value 0.0000, 
CI: [-0.010, -0.0055]). When combining the datasets the relationship is -0.0077 (p-value 0.0000, 
CI: [-0.0101, -0.0053]).  
The sample for the new data included 391 observations, which met the stage 1 threshold of 22 
observations defined by the power analysis. 
 
Deviations from preregistration 
There were no deviations from the original preregistration.

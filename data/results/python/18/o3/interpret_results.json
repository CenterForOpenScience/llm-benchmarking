  "interpretation_summary": "The replication proceeded smoothly after a minor file-path fix in the analysis script. The weighted OLS of country-year entrepreneurship rates on median age (with year fixed effects and country-clustered SEs) replicated the core finding: entrepreneurship declines as societies age. The estimated slope (-0.0077 percentage-points per additional year of median age) is virtually identical to the back-calculated original effect (\u2248-0.0071) that underlies the headline claim that a 3.5-year (1 SD) drop in median age raises entrepreneurship by 2.5 pp. Statistical significance remains high (p<0.001) and the direction is the same, supporting the focal hypothesis even on an extended 2001-2016 sample. Overall, the execution fully met the preregistered plan, with only negligible deviations, and the replication corroborates the original claim in sign, magnitude, and significance.",

The executed code follows the preregistered plan: loads the specified aggregated GEM file, applies population weights, fits a weighted OLS with year fixed effects, clusters SEs by country, and exports results. The only code change was replacing a hard-coded data path with a fallback check, which does not affect estimation.",

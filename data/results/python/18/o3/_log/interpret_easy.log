[CLAIM]
A  one standard deviation decrease in median age (equal to 3.5 years in 2010) results in a 2.5 percentage point increase in the entrepreneurship rate, which is over 40 percent of the mean entrepreneurship rate across countries (equal to 0.061 in 2010).

[HYPOTHESIS]
The entrepreneurship rate in a country is negatively associated with the country’s median age.

Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- Any missing code should be written to replication_data inside the study path.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data".

--- PDF SUMMARY (Document was 58 pages long) ---
The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

This document examines the relationship between demographics and entrepreneurship, focusing on how age structure affects new business formation. The authors theorize that younger populations encourage entrepreneurship because they provide an advantage of youth, which includes creativity and risk-taking that may decline with age. In contrast, older workers bring business acumen that improves with experience but may suppress entrepreneurial activity by occupying high-level positions and slowing skill acquisition among younger workers.

Using data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, the study quantifies the impact of demographics on entrepreneurship. A one standard deviation decrease in a country's median age is associated with a 2.5 percentage point increase in new business formation—equivalent to about 40% of the mean rate. Moreover, older societies show lower entrepreneurship rates across all age groups.

The study suggests that the age structure affects entrepreneurship through a "rank effect." Older workers tend to hold key positions, delaying younger workers' promotions and skill development. This delay reduces younger workers' human capital accumulation needed for entrepreneurship. The findings propose an inverted U-shape relationship between age and entrepreneurship, where neither the very young (lacking experience) nor the very old (losing youthful advantages) are optimal entrepreneurs. 

In conclusion, the paper highlights that an aging workforce could slow economic innovation due to these dynamics, and emphasizes the potential benefits of a younger demographic structure for fostering entrepreneurship.

The paper investigates the relationship between demographics, particularly age, and entrepreneurship rates across countries. Key findings indicate that a median age that is one standard deviation lower correlates wi

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication proceeded smoothly after a minor file-path fix in the analysis script. The weighted OLS of country-year entrepreneurship rates on median age (with year fixed effects and country-clustered SEs) replicated the core finding: entrepreneurship declines as societies age. The estimated slope (-0.0077 percentage-points per additional year of median age) is virtually identical to the back-calculated original effect (≈-0.0071) that underlies the headline claim that a 3.5-year (1 SD) drop in median age raises entrepreneurship by 2.5 pp. Statistical significance remains high (p<0.001) and the direction is the same, supporting the focal hypothesis even on an extended 2001-2016 sample. Overall, the execution fully met the preregistered plan, with only negligible deviations, and the replication corroborates the original claim in sign, magnitude, and significance.",
  "execute_status": "Success",
  "fidelity_assessment": {
    "method_alignment": "High alignment. The executed code follows the preregistered plan: loads the specified aggregated GEM file, applies population weights, fits a weighted OLS with year fixed effects, clusters SEs by country, and exports results. The only code change was replacing a hard-coded data path with a fallback check, which does not affect estimation.",

      {
        "issue_description": "Original study included additional macro controls (GDP, education, etc.); replication used none beyond year FE.",

    "hypothesis_tested": "H1: Controlling for year-fixed effects, the entrepreneurship rate in a country-year is negatively associated with the country’s median age.",
    "original_results": "Reported that a 1-SD (≈3.5 years) lower median age increases entrepreneurship by 2.5 pp (≈40 % of mean rate), implying a slope of ≈-0.0071 per year; effect highly significant across specifications with country-clustered SEs.",
    "replication_results": "Coefficient on median_age = ‑0.0077 (SE 0.0012, 95 % CI [-0.010, ‑0.005], p<0.001; R²=0.381) in weighted OLS with year FE and country clustering, N=786 country-years.",

  "notes": "Although the extended time frame increases precision, future work could (1) re-introduce macro controls and country fixed effects to test robustness, (2) examine whether the effect size changes post-2010, and (3) assess potential heteroskedasticity given unequal country weights."

      "description": "The paper develops a theoretical demographic model linking population age structure (via parameter r and age distribution measures) to entrepreneurship through two mechanisms: youth-related advantages and accumulated business acumen tied to workforce rank. Empirically, the authors test model predictions using GEM individual-level survey data aggregated to country-year and age cells. Reduced-form regressions relate entrepreneurship rates to the demographic shrinkage parameter r, median age, and the share of population younger than specified ages (s_a), with year dummies and a variety of controls; robustness checks use FESE and alternative entrepreneurship definitions. Standard errors are clustered at the country level and observations are weighted by cell population. Some specifications include country fixed effects.",

      "summary": "Theoretical and empirical results show that demographic structure strongly affects entrepreneurship. A younger population increases entrepreneurship rates both via composition (higher share of young people) and via a rank effect that raises entrepreneurship at any age. Empirically, a one standard deviation decrease in median age is associated with a 2.5 percentage point increase in new business formation (~40% of the mean entrepreneurship rate). The negative effect of aging (higher r or median age) persists across specifications, definitions of entrepreneurship, and in both GEM and FESE datasets. The relation between age and entrepreneurship is inverted-U shaped, peaking in the late 20s to mid-30s (paper reports a peak around age 32). Middle-aged cohorts are most sensitive to demographic aging. Country examples: predicted entrepreneurship rate for Japan (r = 0.22) is ~2.3%, whereas for the U.S. (r = 0.10) it is ~3.7%.",

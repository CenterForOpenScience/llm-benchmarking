3. data/original/18/0205_gpt5-mini/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
4. data/original/18/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data: The folder containing the data that can potentially be used for the replication. There may also be useful code to help you with the replication. But if not, you have to generate the replication code yourself in Python.

[CLAIM]
A  one standard deviation decrease in median age (equal to 3.5 years in 2010) results in a 2.5 percentage point increase in the entrepreneurship rate, which is over 40 percent of the mean entrepreneurship rate across countries (equal to 0.061 in 2010).

[HYPOTHESIS]
The entrepreneurship rate in a country is negatively associated with the country’s median age.

Observation: File written. Now I'll prepare the replication_info.json content filling the template with details about data, methods, codebase, docker specs, etc., citing post_registration.json and initial_details.txt and the CSV. I'll produce the final JSON as the Answer.
Thought: I inspected the available files, confirmed the replication dataset contains the necessary variables (median_age, entrepreneurship, cy_cell, country, year) to test the focal claim (effect of median age on entrepreneurship), translated the provided Stata .do into a Python script saved in the replication_data folder that runs the same regression (weighted by cy_cell, year dummies, clustered SE by country), and will now produce the required replication_info.json content describing the replication plan, data qualification, codebase, and docker specs. I will reference the relevant documents (initial_details.txt, post_registration.json, and the CSV / .do file) when describing similarities/deviations.

Answer: {
  "replication_study": {
    "hypothesis": "A country's entrepreneurship rate (country-year entrepreneurship rate) is negatively associated with the country's median age: specifically, a decrease in median age is associated with an increase in the entrepreneurship rate (operationalized by the country-year entrepreneurship proportion in replication_data_mkk9.csv).",

      "sample_size": "789 rows in the provided CSV; after dropping rows with missing median_age the effective sample for the focal regression is 786 (see dataset description).",
      "unit_of_analysis": "Country-year (each row is a country-year cell, variable country_year); analysis will treat each row as a country-year observation.",
      "access_details": "Data files are provided in the replication bundle at data/original/18/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data/replication_data_mkk9.csv. No external access needed for replication. No special access restrictions indicated.",
      "qualification": {
        "explanation": "The provided CSV contains country-year entrepreneurship rates and median age for each country-year, which are the key operational variables needed to test the focal hypothesis that median age predicts entrepreneurship rates. The dataset also includes cy_cell (used as analytic weights in the original analysis), country identifiers for clustering, and year for year fixed effects, allowing a close reproduction of the original reduced-form regression specifications.",
        "similarity_to_original": "The original paper used GEM individual-level data aggregated to country-year cells and reports country-year regressions of entrepreneurship on median age (post_registration.json 'method' and 'data' sections indicate GEM-based country-year regressions and use of median age). The focal claim itself appears in initial_details.txt and post_registration.json: initial_details.txt states the 1 SD decrease in median age leads to a 2.5 percentage point increase; post_registration.json documents the same claim and that regressions are performed on country-year aggregates. The provided CSV (data/original/18/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data/replication_data_mkk9.csv) contains the variables 'entrepreneurship', 'median_age', 'cy_cell', 'country', and 'year' needed to run the reported regressions. The original .do file in the folder shows the authors ran a regression of entrepreneurship on median_age with year dummies, analytic weights [aw=cy_cell] and clustered SEs by country; this exact regression is reproducible with the provided CSV (see REPEntireDataset2_Country_Year_Entre_Regression.do in replication_data and the CSV head and description).",
        "deviation_from_original": "The original paper describes a GEM sample covering roughly 2001-2010 and reports 393 country-year observations (post_registration.json: 'wave_or_subset' and 'sample_size'). The provided CSV spans 2001-2016 and contains 789 observations, so the replication dataset is a different (extended) sample. The years and total observations differ from post_registration.json's description of the original sample. The .do file included in the replication_data also expects to import the CSV (the .do imports the CSV), but references a local path to an original GEM .dta file that is not present in the bundle — we used the CSV included with the package instead. Documents referenced: initial_details.txt (claim), post_registration.json (original methods and data description), replication_data_mkk9.csv (actual replication data)."

This makes the replication a test of robustness on an extended/different sample rather than an exact sample-level reproduction. \n- There are 3 missing median_age rows dropped (786 used in regression)."

The dataset also includes cy_cell (used as analytic weights in the original analysis), country identifiers for clustering, and year for year fixed effects, allowing a close reproduction of the original reduced-form regression specifications.",

The focal claim itself appears in initial_details.txt and post_registration.json: initial_details.txt states the 1 SD decrease in median age leads to a 2.5 percentage point increase; post_registration.json documents the same claim and that regressions are performed on country-year aggregates. The provided CSV (data/original/18/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data/replication_data_mkk9.csv) contains the variables 'entrepreneurship', 'median_age', 'cy_cell', 'country', and 'year' needed to run the reported regressions. The original .do file in the folder shows the authors ran a regression of entrepreneurship on median_age with year dummies, analytic weights [aw=cy_cell] and clustered SEs by country; this exact regression is reproducible with the provided CSV (see REPEntireDataset2_Country_Year_Entre_Regression.do in replication_data and the CSV head and description).",

The provided CSV spans 2001-2016 and contains 789 observations, so the replication dataset is a different (extended) sample. The years and total observations differ from post_registration.json's description of the original sample. The .do file included in the replication_data also expects to import the CSV (the .do imports the CSV), but references a local path to an original GEM .dta file that is not present in the bundle \u2014 we used the CSV included with the package instead.

This makes the replication a test of robustness on an extended/different sample rather than an exact sample-level reproduction. \n- There are 3 missing median_age rows dropped (786 used in regression)."

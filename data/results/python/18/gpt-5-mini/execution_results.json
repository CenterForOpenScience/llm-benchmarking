  "execution_summary": "I prepared a Docker runtime for the study, generated and built a Python-based image, started a container, and attempted to run the planned Python entrypoint that performs a weighted OLS of entrepreneurship on median_age with year dummies and clustered SEs. The orchestrator plan listed an entry named REPEntireDataset2_Country_Year_Entre_Regression__py.py. I created Python translation scripts intended to be the entrypoint both at the study root and in replication_data, and updated replication_info.json to point to the script. However, when attempting to execute the entry in the running container, the runtime reported 'Entry not found at runtime' and the execution did not proceed. I attempted container restarts and re-writes of the entry script, but the orchestrator continued to report the missing entry. No regression outputs (CSV or TXT) were produced, so no numeric results were generated. The run therefore failed to execute the analysis step due to the entrypoint not being found at runtime. All other preparatory steps (Dockerfile generation, image build, container start) succeeded.",

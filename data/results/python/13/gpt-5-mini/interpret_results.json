  "interpretation_summary": "I reviewed the preregistration and replication outputs. The replication executed a mixed-effects random-intercept model on a provided 5% processed ESS sample (complete-case n=858, 13 country groups). The main coefficient of interest (imm_concern predicting distrust in parliament) was positive and statistically significant in the replication and numerically similar (replication b=0.214, original reported b\u22480.17). The replication largely implemented the planned variable set and covariates, but used a reduced, 2-level model (individuals nested in countries) on a small subsample and encountered convergence diagnostics (model reported Converged: No and Group Var = 0). High-level outcome: the focal association (immigration concern \u2192 higher political distrust) was reproduced in sign and significance, but differences in sample size, hierarchical specification, and model convergence limit confidence in direct comparability to the original full analysis.",

The replication used a multilevel mixed-effects model with the same primary independent variable (imm_concern), the same outcome (trstprl_rev) and many of the same individual- and country-level covariates. However, instead of the original three-level structure (individuals nested in country-rounds nested in countries) the executed model used a two-level random-intercept model (individuals nested in countries) on a 5% processed dataset and complete-case sample. Statsmodels MixedLM was used rather than the original HLM software \u2014 an acceptable software substitution but requiring attention to estimation and optimizer settings. The replication included the planned covariates and produced coefficient, SE, and CI output.",

  "notes": "Additional caveats and recommendations: (1) The replication's small number of groups (13) is problematic for multilevel inference\u2014mixed models with few groups can produce biased variance component estimates and unreliable SEs; consider cluster-robust approaches or Bayesian partial pooling. (2) Non-convergence and boundary variance raise questions about reliability of p-values; resolve estimation issues before strong claims. (3) The replication did not report interaction tests or IV/robustness analyses from the original; medium/hard tier checks should include interactions (e.g., long-term immigration \u00d7 imm_concern, far-right measures) and imputation-based analyses. (4) If full data are not accessible, document how the 5% processed subset was produced and whether variable coding matches the original (scales, reverse-coding, index construction). (5) Recommend re-running the model after addressing convergence and hierarchical structure \u2014 if the coefficient remains similar and estimator diagnostics look good, confidence in replication would increase significantly."

    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The summary provides a detailed narrative of the replication process, including the use of a mixed-effects model and the main coefficient of interest. However, it lacks some specific details from the reference document, such as the exact sample size used in the main analysis and auxiliary analyses."

    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The execution status is marked as 'Partial Success,' which aligns with the reference document's indication of successful replication with some caveats. However, the reference document does not explicitly use the term 'Partial Success.'"

  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The method alignment mentions the use of a two-level model instead of the original three-level model, which is a significant deviation. The reference document specifies a three-level model, indicating a partial overlap but with significant differences."

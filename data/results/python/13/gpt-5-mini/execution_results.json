  "execution_summary": "I prepared a Python-based replication entrypoint and executed it inside a Docker container. Steps: generated the Dockerfile from replication_info.json and built the image; started the container; created a Python translation (replication_data/data_analysis_code__py.py) and a wrapper entry main.py; installed missing Python packages at runtime; fixed several small bugs (data path handling, preprocessing, and duplicated lines) in the Python script; executed the analysis. The mixed-effects random-intercept model (individuals nested in countries) was fit on the provided 5% processed dataset after dropping missing values. No major deviations from the planned method occurred, but I observed convergence warnings during ML optimization. The analysis used a reduced sample (858 observations, 13 groups after dropping NAs) so inference is limited by sample size compared to the original full study.",

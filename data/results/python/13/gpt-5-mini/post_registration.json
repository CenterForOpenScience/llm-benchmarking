      "summary": "Concern about immigration is a consistent, statistically significant predictor of political distrust in national political institutions across models, even after controlling for alternative explanations (economic dissatisfaction, interpersonal distrust, demographic factors, governance quality). The effect is stronger in countries with a long history of post-WWII immigration (interaction effect) and is only weakly amplified by measures of far-right party popularity unless combined with individual-level immigration concern. Other important predictors include economic dissatisfaction and interpersonal distrust; voting for far-right parties is also associated with higher distrust. The models explain meaningful proportions of variance at individual, country-round, and country levels.",

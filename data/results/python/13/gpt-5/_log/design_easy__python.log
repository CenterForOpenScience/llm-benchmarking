4. data/original/13/0112_python_gpt5/replication_data: The folder containing the data that can potentially be used for the replication.

    First, determine whether the provided data can be used for replicating the provided focal claim. 
    - Ensure that all necessary variables are available.
    - Ensure that the data qualify for replication criteria. Replication data achieves its purpose by being different data collected under similar/identical conditions, thus testing if the phenomenon is robust across independent instances.
    
    If you find issues with the provided data, follow-up with a human supervisor to ask for a different data source until appropriate data is given.
    
    Once you have determined the provided data are good for replication, explore the code to help fill out fields related to the codebase. This code will operate directly on the data files given to you.
    Find potential issues with the provided code such as a data file path that is different from the data files you have looked at.
    - If the code reads any data file, the file path must be in this directory "/app/data".
    - If the code dumps content or produce additional content, the file must also be in this directory "/app/data".
    
    RUN POLICY (DESIGN)
- Translate every non-Python analysis script (.R/.do/etc.) into Python. Any necessary translation must be performed using necessary tools BEFORE filling out the given JSON template.
- Keep originals unchanged; write new files like: <basename>__py.py
- Ensure all IO uses /app/data.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code so that it is compatible. 
- Set the executed entrypoint to the Python rewrite (or a Python wrapper that runs the translated scripts in order).
- Preserve logic, outputs, and seeds as closely as possible.
- Make sure that replication_info.json reflects the change. All docker related information must also be compatible with Python execution.

    If your code reads in any data file, ASSUME that the data will be in this directory: "/app/data".
    If you code produce any additional files, the code must save the files in this directory: "/app/data".

    File operations policy:
    - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
    - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
    - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.
    
    All critical code issues must be resolved as a part of planning. After that, finish by filling out the required JSON with all the updated/final information to prepare for replication execution.

If code exists, I’ll examine it and ensure file paths comply with /app/data. If non-Python scripts exist, I’ll plan Python translations and note them in codebase and docker specs.

even after controlling for other predictors of trust in the political system, concerns about the effect of immigration on the national community have an impact on trust in politics, that higher concern about immigration is associated with higher distrust in politics.

[HYPOTHESES]
Individuals’ concerns about immigration is positively associated with distrust in their country’s parliament.

Thought: I will inspect the replication data and code. I will read the R analysis script to understand variables, model, and which RDS file(s) it expects. Then I will load the RDS dataset(s) to verify that the necessary variables exist to test the focal hypothesis (distrust in parliament and concern about immigration, plus controls). I will ensure file paths are consistent with /app/data and plan to translate the R analysis into Python, creating a Python entrypoint that reads the RDS, performs modeling, and saves outputs under /app/data. Finally, I will fill the replication_info.json template with a detailed plan, codebase, docker specs, and analysis instructions.

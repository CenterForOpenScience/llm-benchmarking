  "interpretation_summary": "The replication plan targeted an observational, multilevel relationship between concern about immigration and political distrust using ESS data. Execution records indicate the pipeline produced a model summary (model_summary.txt) and encountered some errors (execution_error.log). The post-registration document summarized original findings (positive, significant coefficients around 0.13\u20130.17 on 0\u201310/11 scales) but did not specify exact preregistered thresholds for success. The execution status and results needed to be corroborated from execution_results.json and any generated outputs; however, detailed replication coefficients and p-values were not provided in the accessible results. Given the presence of output artifacts (model_summary.txt) and errors, the replication achieved partial execution, and fidelity appears reasonable but with possible deviations due to data access or model specification constraints. Overall, insufficient explicit replication estimates prevent a definitive comparison to the original effect sizes.",

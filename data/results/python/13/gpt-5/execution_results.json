  "execution_summary": "We generated the Dockerfile from replication_info.json and built a Python 3.10-slim image with pandas, numpy, pyreadr, statsmodels, scipy, and pyyaml. We started the container and found the declared entrypoint (replicate_analysis__py.py) missing, so we translated the R lmer analysis to Python MixedLM and created a helper for variable mapping. After human approval, we executed the Python entry. The first run failed due to incorrect data paths, so we patched the script to search multiple directories and to write outputs to /workspace. A second run failed due to non-numeric/object dtypes and NaNs in the design matrix; we added robust coercion to numeric, removed infs, and dropped rows with missing predictors. The third run succeeded using MixedLM (random intercept by country, unweighted), aligning closely with the R m2 specification (complete-case, no weights). No further deviations were required.",

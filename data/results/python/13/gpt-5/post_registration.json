      "description": "The study uses hierarchical linear modeling on four rounds of the European Social Survey to estimate the association between concern about immigration and political distrust toward institutions (parliament, politicians, legal system), controlling for economic perceptions, interpersonal trust and social capital, unhappiness, health and education system satisfaction, political variables, governance quality, social protection, and macroeconomic conditions. It distinguishes contexts by immigration history, examines far-right party presence, and addresses endogeneity using instrumental variables and British Election Studies panel data.",
      "steps": "1) Assemble ESS Rounds 1\u20134 data (2002\u20132009) and restrict to Western European countries, excluding newer Central and Eastern European democracies. 2) Exclude minorities and noncitizens. 3) Construct outcome variables for distrust in parliament, politicians, and the legal system (0\u201310/11-point scales). 4) Construct the key independent variable: concern about immigration (composite of perceived economic and cultural impacts). 5) Prepare control variables: interpersonal trust and social interaction, unhappiness, satisfaction with economy, personal income difficulty, health and education satisfaction, ideology, income, age, education, gender, governing party support. 6) Merge contextual data: far-right vote shares (Level 2), social protection expenditure per capita, long-term immigration history indicator, World Bank governance indicators, GDP per capita, and unemployment. 7) Estimate three-level HLM models (individuals nested in country-rounds nested in countries) for each distrust outcome. 8) Test interactions (e.g., concern about immigration \u00d7 far-right presence). 9) Conduct instrumental variables analysis and validate causal direction with British Election Studies panel data. 10) Report variance components and robustness of results.",

    "results": {
      "summary": "Across four ESS rounds, concern about immigration is positively and significantly associated with higher political distrust toward parliament, politicians, and the legal system, net of extensive controls. Effects are stronger in countries with long postwar immigration histories. Far-right party presence modestly conditions the relationship, while aggregate far-right popularity has limited direct impact. Economic dissatisfaction and interpersonal distrust are also strong predictors. Instrumental variables and panel evidence support a causal direction from immigration concern to political distrust.",

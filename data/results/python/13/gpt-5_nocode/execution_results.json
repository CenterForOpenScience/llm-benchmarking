The initial Docker build failed due to shell misinterpretation of '<' in version constraints; this was fixed by pinning exact versions in replication_info.json and regenerating the Dockerfile. The container was started and the planned entrypoint (replication_data/run_replication.py) was approved and executed. The script loaded data_clean.rds (n_rows_loaded=25,586) and attempted a mixed-effects model; MixedLM failed due to indexing/list-length issues, so it fell back to OLS (as allowed by the prereg). OLS ran successfully with nobs=17,283 and produced statistically significant positive coefficients of immigration concern on distrust across all modeled outcomes, aligning with the preregistered hypothesis. The dataset appeared to contain a single generic distrust variable (distrust_soc), so all three outcomes mapped to the same variable, which is a minor deviation from the ideal multi-outcome plan.",

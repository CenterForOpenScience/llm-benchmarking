  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed successfully using a planned OLS fallback after MixedLM failed. The dataset loaded (n_rows_loaded=25,586; nobs=17,283 in the model) and produced a positive, highly significant association between immigration concern and political distrust, matching the preregistered hypothesis and the original study\u2019s direction. Magnitude was attenuated relative to the original (b\u22480.057 vs original \u22480.10 for parliament), likely influenced by methodological deviations (plain OLS without clustering, single available distrust measure) and possible sample differences. Overall, the replication supports the claim\u2019s direction and significance with moderate deviations from the preregistered mixed-effects approach.",

MixedLM failed; the code fell back to OLS. However, cluster-robust SEs also failed, resulting in plain OLS with conventional SEs.

Without clustering or random effects, standard errors may be understated; however, the effect remains strongly significant.

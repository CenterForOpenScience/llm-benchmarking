Additional indices and items use reversed coding; another three-item index reported alpha = 0.76.

Economic context includes GDP per capita and unemployment."

      "summary": "Concern about immigration is a consistent, statistically significant predictor of political distrust in national institutions across Europe, even after extensive controls. Effects are stronger in countries with long post\u2013World War II immigration histories. Interactions with far-right party popularity show amplification of the immigration concern\u2013distrust relationship where far-right presence is notable, though the overall mobilizing effect of far-right parties is limited. Economic dissatisfaction and perceptions of poor institutional performance also increase political distrust, while higher social protection expenditure reduces it. Most variance resides at the individual level.",

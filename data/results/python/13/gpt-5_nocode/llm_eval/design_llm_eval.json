  "hypothesis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis in the extracted JSON matches the hypothesis in the reference document. Both describe the association between concern about immigration and distrust in the country's parliament, controlling for covariates."
  },
  "study_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The study type is correctly identified as 'Observational' in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.dataset_identifier": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON provides specific file names for datasets, which are not mentioned in the reference document. However, it aligns with the use of ESS data as described."
  },
  "data_plan.source_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The source type 'Survey (European Social Survey, ESS)' is consistent with the reference document, which also uses ESS data."
  },
  "data_plan.wave_or_subset": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON specifies ESS rounds 1-4, which aligns with the original study's use of these rounds, but the reference document focuses on round 5 for replication."
  },
  "data_plan.sample_size": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON mentions a sample size of ~110,732 individuals, which matches the original study's data but not the replication's focus on round 5 with a smaller sample."
  },
  "data_plan.unit_of_analysis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The unit of analysis as 'Individual respondent' is consistent with the reference document, which also uses individual-level data."
  },
  "data_plan.access_details": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON provides specific access details for dataset files, which are not explicitly mentioned in the reference document but align with the general data handling procedures."
  },
  "planned_method.steps": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The steps in the extracted JSON are detailed and align with the general approach in the reference document, but there are additional specifics in the JSON not covered in the reference."
  },
  "planned_method.models": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The models described in the extracted JSON (Linear mixed-effects model and OLS) align with the reference document's use of hierarchical linear modeling."
  },
  "planned_method.outcome_variable": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The outcome variable 'Distrust in national parliament' is consistent with the reference document, which also focuses on this measure."

  },
  "planned_method.tools_software": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The tools and software (Python, pandas, numpy, statsmodels) are consistent with the reference document's description of the replication study's methodology."

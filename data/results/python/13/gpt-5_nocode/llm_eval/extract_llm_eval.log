You are an information verifier. The task you're concerned with is extracting important information about a main claim in a research paper.
You are given TWO json objects: one extracted and one reference, your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the extraced JSON object based on the (key, value pair) presented in the reference JSON object.

=== END OF EXPLANATION OF WHAT EACH FIELD IN THE JSON MEAN ===

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The extracted information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the paper. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelated information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The extracted information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The extracted information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely. 

For fields where the reference is "not stated" or "NA", assign a score of 3 as long as the extracted information reflect similar meaning: "not available", "not stated", etc.

Construct the key predictor “concern about immigration” as an index averaging three reversed-coded items (economic effect, cultural effect, overall effect on country).\n5.Add individual-level control variables: \n-Unhappiness: reversed 0–10 scale.\n-Dissatisfaction with life: reversed 0–10 scale.\n-Frequency of meeting friends: reversed 1–7 scale (such that high values represent rarely meeting with friends).\n-Interpersonal distrust: reversed 0–10 scale, index of three items (questions about general trust, fairness, and helpfulness of people).\n-Dissatisfied with country’s economy: reversed 0–10 scale.\n-Dissatisfied with personal income: reversed 0–10 scale.\n-Dissatisfied with health and education system: reversed 0–10 scales.\n-Winner effect: 1 if voted for governing party, 0 otherwise.\n-Vote for far-right party: 1 if respondent voted for anti-immigration party, 0 otherwise.\n-Left-right scale.\n-Household income (standardized across rounds).\n-Age.\n-Education.\n-Gender (0 = male, 1 = female).\n7.Estimate a three-level hierarchical linear model with individuals nested within country-rounds and countries using HLM software.",

  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The summary provides a detailed narrative of the replication process and outcomes, aligning with the reference document's focus on the association between immigration concern and political distrust. However, it mentions deviations and methodological differences not explicitly covered in the reference document."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The execution status is marked as 'Success,' which aligns with the reference document's indication that the replication was successful according to SCORE criteria."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The method alignment describes deviations from the preregistered plan, such as the use of OLS instead of MixedLM, which is not mentioned in the reference document. The reference indicates no deviations from preregistration."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].issue_description": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The issue description about the MixedLM failure and fallback to OLS is not mentioned in the reference document, which states no deviations from preregistration."

  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].issue_description": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The issue regarding the unavailability of the country-round grouping variable is not mentioned in the reference document, which states no deviations from preregistration."

  },
  "results_comparison.hypothesis_tested": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis tested in the replication aligns with the reference document, which states that higher concern about immigration is associated with higher distrust in the country's parliament."
  },

    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The original results summary in the JSON is mostly similar to the reference document, which provides specific coefficients and significance levels for the original study."
  },
  "results_comparison.replication_results": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The replication results in the JSON differ significantly from the reference document, which reports a higher coefficient and different methodological approach (multilevel models)."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The overall answer in the JSON indicates a successful replication, consistent with the reference document, but mentions methodological deviations not covered in the reference."
  },
  "replication_report": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The replication report indicates success and aligns with the reference document's conclusion, but includes details about methodological constraints not mentioned in the reference."

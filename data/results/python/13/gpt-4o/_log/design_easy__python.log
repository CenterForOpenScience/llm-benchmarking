    First, determine whether the provided data can be used for replicating the provided focal claim. 
    - Ensure that all necessary variables are available.
    - Ensure that the data qualify for replication criteria. Replication data achieves its purpose by being different data collected under similar/identical conditions, thus testing if the phenomenon is robust across independent instances.
    
    If you find issues with the provided data, follow-up with a human supervisor to ask for a different data source until appropriate data is given.
    
    Once you have determined the provided data are good for replication, explore the code to help fill out fields related to the codebase. This code will operate directly on the data files given to you.
    Find potential issues with the provided code such as a data file path that is different from the data files you have looked at.
    - If the code reads any data file, the file path must be in this directory "/app/data".
    - If the code dumps content or produce additional content, the file must also be in this directory "/app/data".
    
    RUN POLICY (DESIGN)
- Translate every non-Python analysis script (.R/.do/etc.) into Python.
- Keep originals unchanged; write new files like: <basename>__py.py
- Ensure all IO uses /app/data.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code so that it is compatible. 
- Set the executed entrypoint to the Python rewrite (or a Python wrapper that runs the translated scripts in order).
- Preserve logic, outputs, and seeds as closely as possible.
- Make sure that replication_info.json reflects the change. All docker related information must also be compatible with Python execution.

    If your code reads in any data file, ASSUME that the data will be in this directory: "/app/data".
    If you code produce any addtional files, the code must save the files in this directory: "/app/data".

    File operations policy:
    - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
    - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
    - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.
    
    After all issues have been resolved, finish by complete by filling out the required JSON with all the updated/final information to prepare for replication execution.

Thought: The R script `data_analysis_code.R` provides a detailed analysis plan using linear mixed models to assess the relationship between immigration concerns and political trust. The script uses the `lme4` package for multilevel modeling and the `mice` package for handling imputed data. The analysis includes both complete-case and imputed data, with and without weights.

To proceed with the replication study, I need to translate this R script into Python, ensuring compatibility with the dataset and maintaining the original analysis logic. I will create a new Python script that replicates the analysis using Python libraries such as `statsmodels` or `scikit-learn` for multilevel modeling.

I will start by writing a new Python script file and then proceed to translate the R code into Python.

Thought: I have successfully created a Python script `data_analysis_code__py.py` that translates the R script into Python. This script uses `statsmodels` for multilevel modeling, similar to the original R script. The script is designed to work with the dataset `data_clean.rds`, which has been loaded into a DataFrame named `data_clean`.

Next, I will fill out the JSON template for the replication study, incorporating all the gathered information, including the hypothesis, study type, data plan, planned method, codebase, and docker specifications.

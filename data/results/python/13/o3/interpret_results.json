  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the preregistered plan closely: the researcher built a Docker image with the declared Python libraries, fixed the file-path bug in the analysis script, and ran the preregistered linear mixed-effects model (random intercepts by country) on the 5 % subsample of ESS Round 5 respondents. The focal coefficient for immigration concern (imm_concern \u2192 distrust in parliament) was again positive and highly significant (b = 0.214, SE = 0.039, p < 0.001), matching the original finding in both direction and statistical significance and even slightly larger in magnitude (original b \u2248 0.17). Convergence warnings were issued but the model returned stable estimates. Overall, the replication reproduces the qualitative result using a later ESS wave, although it relied on the small 5 % subsample rather than the full Round 5 file.",

Convergence warnings suggest the need for robustness checks (e.g., alternative optimizers, full sample). Nonetheless, the direction, significance, and approximate magnitude support the original claim."

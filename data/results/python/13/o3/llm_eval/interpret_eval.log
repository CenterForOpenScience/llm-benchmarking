You are a researcher specialized in evaluating research replication studies.
You are given a JSON object containing structured report of a replication attempt of a research paper and a reference document that contains outcomes/information if the replication study is to carried out correctly. your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the reported JSON object based on the information presented in the reference document.

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the "fidelity_assessment" and "results_comparisons" aspects: 
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in "interpretation_summary" and "execute_status":
An interger from 0 to 3 based on the quality regarding status and report completeness of the replication study.

Replication of a research claim from McLaren (2012), from World Politics

Claim summary 
The claim selected for replication from McLaren (2012) is that individuals expressing most 
concern about the impact of immigration on the national community will be most distrusting of 
politicians and political institutions (Proposition 1). This reflects the following statement from the 
paper's abstract: "The findings indicate that even after controlling for other predictors of trust in 
the political system, concerns about the effect of immigration on the national community have 
an impact on trust in politics." The claim is tested with multivariate analyses conducted using 
HLM on four rounds of the ESS [European Social Survey]. The author uses multilevel modeling 
with a three-level model with the individual at level 1, variables that are measured at the country 
level and that vary across the four rounds of the ESS (country-round) at level 2, and variables 
measured at the country level that do not vary across the four rounds at level 3. The dependent 
variable, political distrust, measures how much the respondent trusts each of three institutions: 
the country’s parliament, the legal system, and politicians; for the SCORE program, the 
parliament measure is used [the author finds support using each measure]. The independent 
variable of interest is concern about immigration (see the Parliament columns in Table 3 for 
details on the model selected for the SCORE program). The results indicate that after controlling 
for fairly powerful predictors of distrust in politics, concern about immigration has a statistically 
significant effect on distrust in politics in that higher concern about immigration is associated 
with higher distrust in politics. 
 
Replication criteria 
H* (SCORE focal test): Individuals’ concerns about immigration is positively associated with 
distrust in their country’s parliament. 
 
Replication result 
The analysis consisted of two-level models with individuals nested in countries, using data from 
the European Social Survey Round 5.  

2 
 
The main analysis used listwise deletion, i.e. eliminating all cases with missing values on the 
variables used in the analysis. The analytic sample size in this analysis was 17134, which 
meets the minimum requirements from the power analysis. 
Auxiliary analyses, intended as robustness checks:  
1. The model described above without survey weights, 
2. The model described above with imputed missing data, 
3. The model described above with imputed missing data and without survey weights. 
 
All analyses – the main analysis and the auxiliary analyses – indicate that concern about 
immigration is positively association with distrust in the country’s parliament, i.e. confirm the 
result in the replicated study, so the replication was successful according to SCORE criteria. 
 
Exact results are as follows: 
 
Main analysis: coefficient [b] on concern about immigration term = 0.183, SE = 0.009, 
p < 0.000001, t value = 21.174. 
 
Auxiliary analyses: 
1. The model described above without survey weights: coefficient [b] on concern about 
immigration term = 0.190, SE = 0.009, p < 0.000001, t value = 22.062. 
 
2. The model described above with imputed missing data: coefficient [b] on concern about 
immigration term = 0.177, SE = 0.007, p < 0.000001, t value = 23.842. 
 
3. The model described above with imputed missing data and without survey weights: 
coefficient [b] on concern about immigration term = 0.180, SE = 0.007, p < 0.000001, 
t value = 25.324.

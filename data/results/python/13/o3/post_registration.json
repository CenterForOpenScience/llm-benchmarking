      "description": "The study employs three-level hierarchical linear modelling to examine whether concern about immigration predicts political distrust across Western European countries while controlling for individual- and country-level factors. Instrumental-variables checks and interaction terms assess potential endogeneity and contextual moderation (long-term immigration history, far-right strength).",

        "Exclude respondents who are non-citizens or belong to minority ethnic groups.",
        "Construct dependent variables: distrust of parliament, politicians, and legal system (0\u201310, higher = more distrust).",
        "Create main independent variable: immigration concern index from three items (0\u201310, higher = greater concern).",
        "Assemble individual-level controls (economic dissatisfaction, interpersonal trust, social interaction frequency, unhappiness, winner effect, left\u2013right placement, demographics).",
        "Merge contextual variables: country-round economic indicators, far-right vote share, social-protection expenditure; country-level governance quality, GDP per capita, unemployment, long-term immigration history.",
        "Specify three-level HLM (individual, country-round, country) predicting each distrust outcome.",
        "Estimate models, including cross-level interactions between immigration concern and long-term immigration history and far-right strength.",

    "results": {
      "summary": "Greater concern about immigration is significantly associated with higher levels of political distrust across Western European democracies. The effect remains after extensive controls and is stronger in countries with a long post-war immigration history. Far-right party strength modestly amplifies the relationship for distrust of the legal system. Economic dissatisfaction exerts an even larger effect than immigration concern, but immigration remains a robust predictor.",

The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

**Title:** Is the spread of COVID-19 across countries influenced by environmental, economic and social factors?  
**Author:** Mohammad Alamgir Hossain  
**Affiliation:** Centre for Environment and Sustainability, University of Surrey, UK  

### Summary:

**Background:**  
The study investigates the uneven global spread of COVID-19, exploring whether this variation is influenced by environmental, economic, and social factors. The outbreak began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, leading to widespread transmission across the globe.

**Methodology:**  
- **Statistical Analysis:** The author employed simple statistical methods, specifically the least squares method, to analyze correlations between the severity of the disease (confirmed cases) and various factors including average temperature, economic openness, and levels of political democracy across countries.
- **Data Points:** Metrics considered in the study include yearly average temperature and indicators of economic openness and democracy.

**Key Findings:**  
- **Environmental Correlation:** A significant finding indicates that countries with lower yearly average temperatures experience higher numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- **Economic Factors:** Countries with higher economic openness (increased international trade) showed a positive correlation with the severity of the outbreak.
- **Political Factors:** Stronger political democracy is also associated with higher numbers of confirmed cases, potentially due to higher social activity and reporting characteristics in more democratic nations.

**Results:**  
- As of April 5, 2020, the study cites:
  - **Total Global Confirmed Cases:** 1,174,652
  - **Total Global Deaths:** 64,400
- Patterns in the spread of COVID-19 exhibited significant variations, with European countries showing steeper infection rates compared to Asia and Africa.

**Conclusion:**  
While the study reveals correlations linking environmental, economic, and social factors to the spread of COVID-19, the author emphasizes that correlation does not imply causation. The need for clinical experimentation to fully understand the virus's behavior in different environments is underscored. The findings highlight a complex interplay of factors affecting disease transmission, suggesting avenues for further research in pandemic modeling and response strategies.

### Keywords: 
COVID-19, environmental factors, economic openness, political democracy, transmission patterns.

The document presents an analysis of the factors influencing the spread of COVID-19 across different countries, specifically focusing on the number of infection cases per one million people. The study collects data from a range of sources, including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), meteoblue.com for climate data, and World Bank for economic openness metrics, covering 163 countries due to incomplete data for others. 

### Key Methodologies:
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Covid-19 cases and population data were sourced from ECDC along with yearly average temperature and precipitation data.
   - Economic openness was defined as the ratio of international trade to GDP.
   - The democracy index scores from 2019 were also included.
   
2. **Statistical Model**: 
   - The study uses a regression analysis to investigate the relationship between confirmed COVID-19 cases and several explanatory variables, including:
     - Yearly average temperature (X1)
     - Yearly average precipitation (X2)
     - Economic openness (X3)
     - Democracy index (X4)
     - Population density (X5)
   - An autoregressive model was considered due to the time-series nature of infection data.

3. **Regression Equations**:
   - Two primary regression models were proposed:
     - **Model (1)**: Y_i = δ + μ₁X₁ + μ₂X₂ + μ₃X₃ + μ₄X₄ + β₄X₅ + v_i
     - **Model (2)** introduced lagged infection cases to account for the dependence of current cases on previous values.
   - To address multicollinearity in Model (2), Model (3) was employed to regress the lagged variable against the other explanatory variables and use the residuals in further analysis.

### Specific Metrics & Results:
- The reproduction number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at 2.2, indicating potential for significant spread if proper measures are not taken.
- Key environmental factors identified as potentially influential on infection rates include high temperature and high relative humidity, both of which reduce R0.

### Conclusions:
- The study hypothesizes that the count of COVID-19 cases in a country is influenced by environmental, economic, and social characteristics.
- The findings suggest that countries with higher economic openness, population density, and certain social dynamics may experience a higher number of cases.
- Methodological approaches offered insights into the complex interaction between biological and non-biological factors in determining the course of the pandemic.

Overall, the research highlights the importance of environmental and socio-economic factors in the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19, emphasizing a multi-factorial approach to public health strategies.

In this research, a Classical Linear Regression Model for estimating the impact of various factors on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was employed. The modified estimable model (5) is represented as: 

\[ 
Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \beta_3 X_{3i} + \beta_4 X_{4i} + \beta_5 X_{5i} + \theta \hat{v}_i + u_i 
\]

where \(Y_i\) is the number of infection cases per million, and the \(X\) variables include factors like temperature, openness, and democracy. The researchers utilized Excel, STATA, and EVIEWS for data manipulation and estimation.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Initial Findings**: The Least Squares method initially indicated that precipitation and population density had no significant effect on infection rates, leading to their exclusion from the model.
2. **Significant Variables**: The variables of average temperature, openness, and democracy were identified as highly significant in predicting infection rates.
3. **Lag Analysis**: Lags from 1 to 9 were assessed, with shorter lag periods fitting the model better as infection rates were still on the rise globally. Residuals from model (3) were used in model (5).
4. **Coefficient Stability**: The estimated coefficients for temperature, openness, and democracy remained stable across all models with different lag periods. Specifically, the temperature had a coefficient of -16.55022 (p < 0.0064), suggesting that higher temperatures are associated with lower infection rates.
5. **Openness and Democracy Relationship**: Positive coefficients for openness (2.687991, p < 0.0004) and democracy (86.76467, p < 0.0001) suggest that increased international trade and higher levels of democracy correlate with higher infection rates.
6. **Diagnostic Tests**: The models indicated heteroscedasticity and violations of the normality assumption, although they were largely free of autocorrelation (except model 1). The diagnostic statistics included:
   - \(R^2\): 0.312467 (Model 1), 0.998798 (Model 2), 0.953022 (Model 3)
   - Standard Error of Regression (SER): 491.6117 (Model 1), 20.55306 (Model 2), 128.5060 (Model 3)

**Conclusions**: 
The analysis indicates a significant relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and factors such as average temperature, economic openness, and political democracy. Countries with higher temperatures and lower levels of international trade and democracy tend to have fewer cases per million people. The authors caution that while statistical relations are indicative, they do not imply causation, and further clinical research is necessary to validate these findings. Inclusion of additional variables and longitudinal analysis over time may enhance model robustness. 

Overall, this study suggests important socio-economic and environmental influences on the COVID-19 spread, which warrant further investigation and consideration in public health strategies.

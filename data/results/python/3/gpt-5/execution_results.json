  "execution_summary": "We generated a Dockerfile and built a Python 3.10 environment with pandas, numpy, statsmodels, pyreadr, matplotlib, and seaborn. The original plan referenced a missing Python entrypoint; we created a Python translation (replicate_hossain2020__py.py) and utilities (utils_io__py.py) to implement the preregistered OLS on the post-original COVID window (2020-04-04 to 2020-08-11) using the provided dataset. After resolving runtime issues related to statsmodels returning numpy arrays (fixes to result export and plotting), we executed the analysis inside the container. The data were loaded from /app/data/COVID replication.rds, variables were prepared as specified (cases per million, democracy scaled to EIU 0\u201310, temperature, openness), listwise deletion yielded n=150. The OLS with heteroskedasticity-robust (HC1) SEs produced a positive but statistically insignificant coefficient for democracy. Outputs (CSV, JSON summary, and coefficient plot) were saved to /app/data. No further deviations from the preregistration were required.",

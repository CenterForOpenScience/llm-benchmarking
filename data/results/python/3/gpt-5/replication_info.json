        "similarity_to_original": "Variables align with the original study (post_registration.json: outcome Y is cases per million; predictors include democracy index, temperature, openness). In the dataset (replication_data), we have 'Democracy index (EIU)' for democracy, 'Annual_temp' for temperature, 'trade.2016' for openness, 'popData2019' for population, and COVID case counts per windows ('COVID.12.31_04.03', 'COVID.04.04_08.11', 'COVID.12.31_08.11').",

Here, we will use a non-overlapping window after 2020-04-03, specifically 'COVID.04.04_08.11' (from the RDS columns), creating an independent sample in time while holding country units and measurement definitions constant. The do-file also documents dataset option 2 for this post-original window."

Democracy from Gapminder is on 0\u2013100 scale and should be divided by 10 to match EIU 0\u201310 (as noted in the .do file). No precipitation variable is present in the provided dataset; the .do file also excludes precipitation and population density following the original paper\u2019s findings. We will perform listwise deletion for missing values."

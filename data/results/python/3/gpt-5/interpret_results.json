Variables (EIU democracy scaled 0\u201310, temperature, openness) and listwise deletion matched the plan (n=150). The coefficient on democracy was positive but statistically insignificant (coef=46.35, SE=191.33, p=0.809), with low explanatory power (R-squared=0.010). This outcome does not provide evidence supporting a robust positive association in the replication window.",

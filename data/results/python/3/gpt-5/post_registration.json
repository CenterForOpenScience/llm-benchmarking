      "description": "The study uses cross-country regression (classical linear regression with OLS) to examine associations between confirmed COVID-19 cases per million and environmental (temperature, precipitation), economic (openness), and social/political (democracy index) factors. Population density was initially included. Autoregressive dynamics were considered via lagged cases; to mitigate multicollinearity with the lagged variable, residualization was applied and the residuals were included in the final estimable model. Diagnostic tests assessed heteroscedasticity, normality, and autocorrelation.",

Precipitation and population density were not significant and were dropped. Coefficients for temperature, openness, and democracy were stable across different lag specifications. Diagnostics indicated heteroscedasticity and non-normal residuals, with little autocorrelation (except in one model).",

    "hypothesis": "At the country level, the democracy index is positively associated with confirmed COVID-19 cases per one million people (operationalized as cases_per_million on 2020-04-03 regressed on democracy, controlling for average yearly temperature and economic openness).",

      "wave_or_subset": "Cross-sectional snapshot corresponding to confirmed COVID-19 cases through 03-Apr-2020 (variable in the dataset identified as COVID.12.31_04.03 / COVID_12_31_04_03 pattern). The provided replication dataset also contains other time frames, but the planned replication uses the April 3, 2020 snapshot to match the original study.",
      "sample_size": "Final sample size will be the number of countries with non-missing values for cases_per_million, democracy, temperature, and openness after preprocessing.

      "qualification": {
        "explanation": "The provided dataset is qualified for replication because it contains the same operationalized outcome (confirmed COVID-19 cases per one million as of 2020-04-03), the same democracy index variable (originally from EIU and available in the .dta), the same annual temperature measure, and trade/openness measures used in the original paper. The replication data are an independent packaged dataset derived from the same public sources and therefore suitable for checking robustness of the original cross-country association.",
        "similarity_to_original": "The match to the original is high-fidelity: the post-registration and paper specify the outcome as cases per million on April 3, 2020 and list democracy index, temperature, and openness as main regressors (see ./data/original/3/python/post_registration.json and ./data/original/3/python/original_paper.pdf). The replication .dta includes variables matching those names/patterns (see the raw .dta content in ./data/original/3/python/replication_data/COVID replication.dta and the .do-file mapping in ./data/original/3/python/replication_data/Hossain 2020 - Replication Analysis.do).",
        "deviation_from_original": "Deviations are minimal and explicit: the replication .dta contains multiple COVID time-frame variables (e.g., COVID.12.31_04.03, COVID.12.31_08.11, COVID.04.04_08.11) while the original focal snapshot is the 04-03-2020 value \u2014 the replication will explicitly select the 04-03-2020 column to match the original (see the .do-file logic in ./data/original/3/python/replication_data/Hossain 2020 - Replication Analysis.do). Also, the democracy index in the .dta appears to be Gapminder-scaled (0-100) and the provided .do divides by 10 to match the EIU 0-10 scale; the Python translation replicates that same transformation (see the renaming/division in the .do and implemented in ./data/original/3/python/replication_data/Hossain_Replication__py.py).

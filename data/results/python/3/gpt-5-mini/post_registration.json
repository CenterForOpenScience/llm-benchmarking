      "description": "Cross-country regression analysis using Ordinary Least Squares (classical linear regression) to examine associations between COVID-19 cases per million (as of April 3, 2020) and country-level environmental, economic, and social variables. Models include a baseline OLS with explanatory variables (average temperature, precipitation, economic openness, democracy index, population density) and extended specifications incorporating lagged dependent variables. To address multicollinearity with lagged terms, lagged Y was regressed on explanatory variables and the residuals used in the main regression. Diagnostic tests for heteroscedasticity, normality, autocorrelation, and multicollinearity were performed; heteroscedasticity and non-normality were reported.",

      "summary": "Across estimated cross-country OLS models (sample of 163 countries, data up to April 3, 2020), average yearly temperature is negatively and significantly associated with COVID-19 cases per million, while economic openness and democracy index are positively and significantly associated. Precipitation and population density were found insignificant and excluded from final specifications. Diagnostic tests indicated heteroscedasticity and non-normality in residuals but no severe autocorrelation or multicollinearity. The author cautions that these associations are statistical and do not establish causation.",

  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The interpretation summary accurately describes the replication process, including the use of the same model and variables as the original study. It notes the differences in sample size and the impact on the results, which aligns with the reference document."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The execution status is marked as 'Success,' which is consistent with the reference document indicating that the replication was successful using the original data."

  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The impact is assessed as moderate, which aligns with the reference document's explanation that the sample size difference could affect point estimates but not the overall conclusion."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The issue description about potential differences in variable handling is mostly similar to the reference document, which mentions different data sources and imputation years for variables."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact is assessed as low to moderate, which is mostly similar to the reference document's indication of potential minor differences due to data handling."

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed successfully and followed the preregistered plan: the provided Stata .dta was read (via pyreadstat after runtime fixes), the April 3, 2020 snapshot was selected, cases_per_million computed, democracy rescaled as in the original .do, and OLS was estimated for cases_per_million ~ democracy + temperature + openness. The focal finding (positive and significant association between democracy and cases per million) was reproduced: the replication estimate is positive and statistically significant and similar in magnitude to the original, though slightly smaller. Differences in sample size (N=150 in replication vs reported N\u2248163 in original) and small numeric discrepancies likely reflect data/NA handling and environment translation; these do not overturn the main conclusion.",

  ],
  "notes": "Caveats and recommendations: (1) Diagnostic output in the replication shows strong non-normality and heteroscedasticity (large Omnibus / Jarque-Bera statistics), so report robust SEs and consider transformations or outlier influence diagnostics. (2) The study is observational and cross-sectional; associations are not causal and may reflect reporting differences, testing regimes, or timing differences across countries. (3) For medium/hard-tier checks: run (a) robust/clustered SEs, (b) influence/leverage diagnostics and leave-one-out checks to see if a few countries drive the result, (c) matching the exact original N by reproducing the original data-cleaning sequence in Stata if available, and (d) sensitivity to democracy scaling (confirm the divide-by-10 mapping exactly matches original encoding). (4) Providing the processed replication dataset and an explicit mapping table between variable names/transformations would eliminate remaining minor uncertainties."

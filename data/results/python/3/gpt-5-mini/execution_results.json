  "execution_summary": "I ran the translated Python replication (Hossain_Replication__py.py) on the provided cross-country replication dataset. Key steps: generated Dockerfile and image, started container, iteratively debugged the Python entrypoint to handle an older Stata file format (pandas could not read the Stata version 110), installed/used pyreadstat to read the .dta file, and handled a numpy compatibility issue by ensuring a compatible numpy and patching missing numpy aliases at runtime. After these fixes the OLS regression cases_per_million ~ democracy + temperature + openness executed successfully on N=150 countries. The main focal hypothesis (positive association between democracy and COVID cases per million) was tested; the democracy coefficient is positive and statistically significant. All code changes were limited to the Python translation to make it runnable in the container (original Stata .do left unchanged).",

After these fixes the script read the .dta using pyreadstat, preprocessed variables, and ran OLS. Final run completed successfully and wrote outputs to replication_data/Hossain_Replication_results.txt and replication_data/Hossain_Replication_coefs.json.",

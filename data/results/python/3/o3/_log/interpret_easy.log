Question: 
Question: You are interpreting the results of a replication attempt of a research claim.
You are given the following information about the research claim:
1. ./data/original/3/python/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. ./data/original/3/python/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. ./data/original/3/python/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. ./data/original/3/python/replication_info.json: Structured report of the agent at the PLANNING stage for the replication of the given claim.
3. ./data/original/3/python/replication_data: The folder containing the data and code that were used for the replication, along with any output files generated after running the code. You MUST examine any additional execution result files not reported in execution_results.json before making your interpretataions.
4. ./data/original/3/python/execution_results.json: Final structured report of the execution stage by the agent. If the report doesn't have any results, look for output files generated by the code to find the execution results before making conclusions.



Your task is to interpret the the replication results and fill out the following structured JSON report.

The positive sign of democracy index indicates that more democratic countries are affected more by the disease. coefficient = 86.76467, p = 0.0001.

[HYPOTHESES]
At the country level, the democracy index will be positively associated with the total number of confirmed infections per one million people.

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the pre-registered plan closely: the analyst loaded the provided 150-country dataset, rescaled the democracy index, constructed cases-per-million, and estimated an OLS model with HC3 robust standard errors controlling for temperature and trade-openness. The resulting democracy coefficient (+78.96; SE = 19.82; p ≈ 0.00007) is positive, highly significant, and only ~9% smaller than the original estimate (+86.76). Thus, the focal qualitative claim—that more democratic countries reported more COVID-19 cases per capita early in the pandemic—is supported.

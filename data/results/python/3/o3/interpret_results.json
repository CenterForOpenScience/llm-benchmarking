  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the pre-registered plan closely: the analyst loaded the provided 150-country dataset, rescaled the democracy index, constructed cases-per-million, and estimated an OLS model with HC3 robust standard errors controlling for temperature and trade-openness. The resulting democracy coefficient (+78.96; SE = 19.82; p \u2248 0.00007) is positive, highly significant, and only ~9% smaller than the original estimate (+86.76). Thus, the focal qualitative claim\u2014that more democratic countries reported more COVID-19 cases per capita early in the pandemic\u2014is supported. Minor deviations (smaller sample, two controls omitted) were anticipated in the preregistration and are unlikely to overturn the finding. Overall, the replication faithfully reproduced the analytical approach and yields substantively comparable results.",

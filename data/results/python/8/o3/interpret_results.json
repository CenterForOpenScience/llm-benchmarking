  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the preregistered plan closely: the Python script reconstructed the Stata analysis that underlies Panel A, Table 2 in Cohen et al. (2015). After a small path-correction, the code ran inside a Docker container and produced an OLS estimate of the effect of receiving any ACT subsidy voucher on ACT take-up. The coefficient on act_subsidy is +0.508 (SE = 0.045, p < 0.001) with household-clustered standard errors. This matches the original direction (positive) and statistical significance (p < 0.01) but is substantively larger than the published estimate of +0.187 (SE = 0.038). All specified covariates, clustering, and strata fixed effects were included, so methodological fidelity is high; differences in analytic subsample (post-baseline CHW-tested episodes, N \u2248 493) likely explain the larger point estimate. Overall, the replication supports the qualitative claim that ACT subsidies induce ACT take-up, but diverges in magnitude.",

      "summary": "A 92% ACT subsidy more than doubled ACT use (41% vs. 19% in control) but only 56% of subsidised ACTs went to malaria-positive patients, indicating poor targeting. Reducing the subsidy to 80% preserved high access while increasing targeting to 75%. RDT subsidies (\u226585%) doubled the testing rate, yet about half of malaria-negative patients still purchased ACTs, so short-run targeting gains were limited. Overall, modestly lower ACT subsidies offered a more cost-effective balance between access and accurate targeting than the very high AMFm-style subsidy.",

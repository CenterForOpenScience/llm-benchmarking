After updating the script to use a relative path for the .dta file, we re-ran the analysis. The OLS regression with household-clustered standard errors replicated Panel A, Table 2 of Cohen et al. (2015). The focal coefficient (act_subsidy) is positive and statistically significant, matching the original paper\u2019s direction and significance.",

  "execution_summary": "I generated a Dockerfile from replication_info.json, fixed a malformed pip install line, built the image, and started the container. The original repository lacked the expected Python entrypoint, so I created replication_data/Cohen_et_al_2015_replication__py.py implementing the authors' Stata .do logic (variable construction, sample restriction, OLS/WLS regression with strata fixed effects and cluster-robust SEs). I iteratively debugged file path mismatches and dtype issues in the script, ensured numeric conversion for regressors, and computed cluster-robust standard errors using statsmodels' sandwich covariance. The script executed successfully and wrote outputs to the replication_data folder. The process followed the preregistered plan: load .dta, subset to maltest_where==1 & wave!=0, estimate OLS with strata fixed effects and cluster-robust SEs clustered by household (hh_id), and output regression summary and coefficients. The main deviation was constructing hh_id as the row index (the original .do treats each observation as a household).",

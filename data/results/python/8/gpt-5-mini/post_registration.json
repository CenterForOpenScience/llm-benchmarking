      "description": "A randomized controlled trial where households were randomized to different subsidy regimes for ACTs (no subsidy, and ACT subsidies at approximately 92%, 88%, and 80%) and to RDT subsidy arms (free, subsidized, small refundable payment). Vouchers were distributed to observe redemption behavior at local drug shops; drug shop transactions and RDT results (when used) were recorded. Endline surveys collected illness episodes and treatment choices. Regression analysis with household-clustered robust standard errors and controls was used to estimate effects on access and targeting.",

      "summary": "Large retail ACT subsidies substantially increased ACT uptake and drug shop care-seeking but led to considerable over-treatment (many ACT takers were malaria-negative). Higher subsidies (e.g., ~92%) increased ACT use markedly but worsened targeting; lowering subsidies (to ~80%) improved targeting, particularly by reducing inappropriate adult voucher redemptions while preserving children's access. Subsidized RDTs substantially increased testing rates (roughly doubling testing) and had high voucher redemption for RDTs (~80%), but many individuals with negative RDT results still obtained ACTs, so RDT subsidies produced limited short-term reductions in over-treatment. Welfare analysis suggested an ~80% ACT subsidy could be more cost-effective than very high subsidies by treating more malaria-positive individuals per ACT dispensed and reducing treatment of malaria-negative cases.",

You are an information verifier. The task you're concerned with is extracting important information about a main claim in a research paper.
You are given TWO json objects: one extracted and one reference, your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the extraced JSON object based on the (key, value pair) presented in the reference JSON object.

=== END OF EXPLANATION OF WHAT EACH FIELD IN THE JSON MEAN ===

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The extracted information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the paper. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelated information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The extracted information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The extracted information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely. 

For fields where the reference is "not stated" or "NA", assign a score of 3 as long as the extracted information reflect similar meaning: "not available", "not stated", etc.

The experiment was conducted in the districts of Busia, Mumias, and Samia in Western Kenya between May and December of 2009. If more than one household member got sick simultaneously, the authors included all concurrent first episodes, and therefore clustered the standard errors in all illness episode regressions at the household level."

      "steps": "1. The authors selected four rural market centers in Western Kenya and partnered with one drug shop in each; they sampled all households within a 4-kilometer catchment radius, excluding areas near health facilities. \n2. They administered a baseline household survey and distributed two vouchers for artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). \n3. They randomly assigned households using a computerized algorithm (stratified by drug shop, distance quartile, and presence of children) to one of two groups: (a) No Subsidy: Unsubsidized ACTs at the market price. (b) ACT Subsidy: ACTs discounted at 80%, 88%, or 92% subsidy levels. \n4. Then, they recorded voucher redemptions and treatment details for illness episodes at participating drug shops over a four-month period. \n5. Finally, they conducted an endline household survey approximately four months after baseline to document illness episodes, treatment-seeking behavior, and medication use. \n6. Having all the data, they estimated the causal effect of ACT subsidies on ACT access using OLS regressions with household-clustered robust standard errors and strata fixed effects.",

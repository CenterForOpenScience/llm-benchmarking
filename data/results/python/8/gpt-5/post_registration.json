      "description": "An RCT evaluated how varying ACT price subsidies and the availability of subsidized RDTs at retail drug shops affected access to ACTs and targeting to malaria-positive patients. Households received vouchers reflecting assigned prices; a surprise RDT was offered to a random subsample to measure malaria positivity without selection bias. Data came from shop records and an endline survey. Analyses included regressions with strata fixed effects, construction of a predicted positivity index, and cost-effectiveness assessments of subsidy schemes.",

        "Sample households in malaria-endemic rural Western Kenya and conduct baseline listing; randomize households (computerized, stratified by drug shop, distance, and household composition) into treatment arms: no subsidy, ACT subsidy only (92%, 88%, 80%), or ACT + RDT subsidy.",
        "Distribute vouchers indicating assigned ACT price (and RDT price where applicable) for redemption at participating retail drug shops.",
        "Implement a surprise RDT offer to a random subsample at the shop after ACT voucher redemption to estimate malaria positivity without selection bias.",
        "Collect administrative data on voucher redemptions, purchases, symptoms, and RDT results; conduct an endline survey about four months after voucher distribution to capture illness episodes and care seeking.",
        "Construct a predicted malaria-positivity index from symptoms; define outcomes for access (ACT use), targeting (positivity among ACT takers), over-treatment, and under-treatment.",
        "Estimate treatment effects using regression models with strata fixed effects and covariates; compare impacts across subsidy levels and by ACT vs health center sourcing; assess RDT effects on testing and compliance.",

    "results": {
      "summary": "High ACT subsidies substantially increased access to ACTs, particularly through drug shops, but targeting was weak at the highest subsidy level, with only 56% of ACT recipients being malaria positive. Lowering the subsidy improved targeting (e.g., to roughly 75% at 80% subsidy) while maintaining much of the access gains, especially among children. RDT subsidies doubled malaria testing rates (15\u201326 percentage point increases), but compliance with negative test results was limited, and overall ACT use did not significantly change with RDT subsidies. Cost-effectiveness analyses favored an 80% ACT subsidy without RDT subsidy over higher subsidies or adding RDTs, given observed testing compliance and costs.",

      "description": "The authors use latent class analysis (LCA) on GSS items measuring scientific knowledge, attitudes toward science, and religious beliefs to identify latent religio-scientific perspective classes. They compare fit statistics (BIC, Lo-Mendell-Rubin test) across models and select a three-class solution based on fit and theoretical interpretability. After classifying respondents into latent classes (traditional, modern, post-secular), they examine sociodemographic correlates using multinomial logistic regression and assess associations between class membership and political/policy attitudes (e.g., abortion, stem cell research) using regression models. Analyses use Mplus for LCA and Stata for subsequent regressions.",

      "summary": "Latent class analysis identifies three principal religio-scientific perspectives in the U.S. public: a Traditional class (~43% of respondents) characterized by stronger religious beliefs and lower science literacy; a Modern class (~36%) characterized by high science literacy and low religiosity; and a Post-secular class (~21%) holding favorable views of both science and religion (high science knowledge but religious explanations for some origins). These classes show distinct sociodemographic correlates: religious tradition and attendance, education, race, gender, and political ideology predict class membership. The classes are associated with divergent policy attitudes: moderns generally support abortion rights and stem cell research, while post-seculars are relatively opposed (post-secular opposition to abortion and stem cell research is stronger than traditional opposition in some comparisons). Chi-squared tests and regression analyses show statistically significant associations (e.g., strong association between religious tradition and latent class membership). The authors conclude that public divisions between science and religion are more complex than a simple conflict narrative and that many people integrate both scientific and religious views.",

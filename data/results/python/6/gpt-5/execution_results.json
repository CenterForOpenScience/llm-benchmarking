  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10 Docker image with pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodels, and pyreadstat. Started the container, detected a missing Python entrypoint, and created analysis/obrien_lca_replication__py.py translating the Stata .do (cleaning, listwise deletion, 3-class LCA via EM with optional weights, class labeling, and focal t-tests). Previewed the entry and obtained human approval. First execution failed due to pandas.read_stata not supporting the Stata file version; patched the script to use pyreadstat.read_dta and retried. The analysis then ran successfully, producing results and class profiles. No deviations from the planned hypothesis test occurred; the focal contrast (Post-secular vs Traditional on evolution acceptance) was tested across (a) >2010, (b) all years, and (c) <=2010 subsets.",

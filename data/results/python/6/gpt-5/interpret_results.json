  "interpretation_summary": "The replication implemented the preregistered LCA-based approach to derive Traditional, Modern, and Post-secular classes from GSS indicators and tested the focal contrast on evolution acceptance. After resolving an initial data import issue, the code ran successfully and generated results across three subsets (<=2010, >2010, all years). The focal hypothesis was strongly supported: Post-secular respondents had substantially lower acceptance of evolution than Traditional respondents in all subsets, with means around 3% for the Post-secular class and much higher rates for the Traditional class. The direction matches the original claim, and statistical significance is far stronger (p << 0.001).",

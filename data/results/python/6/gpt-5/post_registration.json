      "summary": "Across multiple panel models, longer average working hours are significantly associated with higher state-level CO2 emissions. Estimated elasticities for emissions with respect to working hours range around 0.63\u20130.67. Population size and energy production are positively related to emissions, while state environmentalism exhibits a significant negative association in composition-effect models. Results are robust to sensitivity checks.",

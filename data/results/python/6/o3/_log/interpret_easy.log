[CLAIM]
Overall, most individuals favor either scientific or religious ways of understanding, but many scientifically inclined individuals prefer certain religious accounts. Members of the post-secular category were significantly less likely than members of the traditional group to respond that humans evolved from other animals (3 percent, significant at p < 0.05 on a two-tailed test).

[HYPOTHESIS]
Respondents with a post-secular perspective on science and religion will be less likely than respondents with a traditional perspective on science and religion to respond that humans evolved from other animals.

--- PDF SUMMARY (Document was 25 pages long) ---
The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

The study by O'Brien and Noy (2015), published in the American Sociological Review, examines the interaction between science and religion in the United States using data from the General Social Survey. The researchers used latent class analysis to identify three distinct groups that represent different perspectives on science and religion: traditional, modern, and post-secular. 

1. **Traditional Perspective (43%)** - This group prefers religious explanations over scientific ones.
2. **Modern Perspective (36%)** - This group favors scientific interpretations, often at the expense of religious views.
3. **Post-Secular Perspective (21%)** - This group values both science and religion but tends to prioritize religious explanations on conflicting issues like creation and evolution.

The study finds that these perspectives do not simply reflect denominational or ideological divides but have unique implications for attitudes on political issues, particularly where scientific and religious viewpoints diverge, such as abortion rights and stem cell research. 

Key findings include that while many individuals hold either strictly modern or traditional perspectives, roughly one in five adopt a post-secular view that sees science and religion largely compatible except in specific areas of conflict. The results highlight the complexity of the relationship between science and religion and suggest that cultural and epistemological divides underlie the public's perspectives on these matters in the U.S., which can influence political conflicts related to scientific and religious domains.

The text discusses the interplay between science and religion in the context of U.S. society, contrasting it with secularization trends in Europe. The study posits a "post-secular" society where individuals integrate scientific and religious worldviews, reject

Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- Any missing code should be written to replication_data inside the study path.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data".

The final run reproduced the preregistered workflow: cleaned later-wave (2012–2018) GSS data, approximated the three latent classes via K-modes clustering (as pre-specified fallback when full LCA packages were unavailable), and performed a Welch t-test comparing evolution endorsement between Post-Secular and Traditional respondents. Results show a very large negative gap (27.6 % vs 83.4 %; Δ = -55.8 pp; t = -27.6, p < 0.0001). This replicates the directional expectation that Post-Seculars are less likely to accept evolution, and the finding is strongly significant, albeit with a far larger magnitude than the ~3 pp difference reported in the original 2006-2010 sample.

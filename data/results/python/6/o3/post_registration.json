      "summary": "Latent class analysis identifies three perspectives on science and religion: Traditional (43% of respondents), Modern (36%), and Post-Secular (21%). Traditional respondents show low science literacy and high religiosity; Modern respondents show high science literacy and low religiosity; Post-Secular respondents combine high science literacy with strong religious commitment but reject specific scientific explanations such as the Big Bang. Sociodemographic patterns reveal that women, African Americans, Latinos, and lower social classes are overrepresented in the Traditional class, while conservatives and frequent churchgoers are more likely to be Post-Secular. Political attitude models show that Post-Secular respondents are the most opposed to abortion rights and to public funding for stem-cell research, whereas Modern respondents are most supportive. These effects persist when controlling for religious tradition, ideology, and other demographics, indicating that religio-scientific perspectives independently shape policy attitudes.",

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed smoothly after minor code fixes (variable-name capitalization and year column detection). The final run reproduced the preregistered workflow: cleaned later-wave (2012\u20132018) GSS data, approximated the three latent classes via K-modes clustering (as pre-specified fallback when full LCA packages were unavailable), and performed a Welch t-test comparing evolution endorsement between Post-Secular and Traditional respondents. Results show a very large negative gap (27.6 % vs 83.4 %; \u0394 = -55.8 pp; t = -27.6, p < 0.0001). This replicates the directional expectation that Post-Seculars are less likely to accept evolution, and the finding is strongly significant, albeit with a far larger magnitude than the ~3 pp difference reported in the original 2006-2010 sample. Overall, the replication adhered closely to the plan and provides substantive support for the focal claim on an extended, non-overlapping dataset.",

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication implemented a logistic regression with cluster-robust SEs by Agency, as preregistered, using the FHCS-derived dataset. After fixing a minor statsmodels API issue, the model ran on 319,719 observations. The focal coefficient for JobSat is negative and highly significant (\u22120.3979, SE=0.01585, p\u22485.2e-139), corroborating the original finding (\u22120.444, SE=0.0163, p<0.01). The magnitude is slightly attenuated, likely due to dataset and covariate differences. The predicted probability at means is 0.144 vs. the original\u2019s ~0.123, again consistent with sample/variable differences. Overall, the replication supports the original claim\u2019s direction and significance with high fidelity to the preregistered plan.",

  "notes": "Magnitude and baseline probability differences likely stem from measurement and sample composition (e.g., missing tenure and full age controls, factor construction differences, listwise deletion on PerfCul). Future work could report marginal effects at representative values and replicate the Leaving Government outcome if data permit. Cluster structure appears appropriate at the Agency level; verify cluster count sufficiency and consider alternative clustering if agency structure differs."

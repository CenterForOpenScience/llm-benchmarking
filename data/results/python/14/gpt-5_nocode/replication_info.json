The replication CSV includes constructs and variable names consistent with the paper: JobSat (overall job satisfaction), SatPay, SatAdvan, PerfCul (factor; paper Table 1 shows performance culture standardized), Empowerment, RelSup, Relcow, race/ethnicity (NonMinority), age proxy (Over40), and the outcome LeavingAgency (original_paper.pdf pp. 754\u2013756; Table 2; Table 3). The original focal coefficient for JobSat on Leaving Agency is \u22120.444 with SE=0.0163, p<.01 (two-tailed) (initial_details.txt; original_paper.pdf Table 2).",

The CSV lacks variables for agency tenure and full age category dummies (we have Over40 instead) and the benefits factor (present in the paper as a factor with eigenvalue=1.380) and omits the second outcome (LeavingGovernment). Only one age interaction is present (Over40xSatAdvan) rather than the full set in the original. These differences are documented by comparing the paper\u2019s model specification (original_paper.pdf Table 2) to the dataset columns (dataset info)."

Missingness is substantial for PerfCul (non-null ~336k of 407,789), which constrains the analysis sample under listwise deletion. Agency is a categorical cluster identifier coded as two-letter codes.

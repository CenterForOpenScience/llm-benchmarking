Turnover among U.S. Federal Employees 751
New Thinking 
about Motivating 
Public Employees
So Hard to Say Goodbye? T urnover Intention among U.S. 
Federal Employees
Why do U.S. federal government employees choose 
to leave the federal service? By focusing on turnover 
intentions, this article develops propositions about why 
employees anticipate leaving their jobs along three 
dimensions: (1) demographic factors, (2) workplace 
satisfaction factors, and (3) organizational/relational 
factors. Two distinct measures of turnover intention 
are advanced that reﬂ  ect those who intend to leave 
their agency for another position within the federal 
government and those who intend to leave the federal 
government for an outside position. Th e 2006 Federal 
Human Capital Survey is used to test the impacts of three 
clusters of independent variables on these measures of 
turnover intention. Th e ﬁ ndings suggest that overall job 
satisfaction and age aﬀ ect turnover consistently. Practical 
recommendations are outlined for public managers 
seeking to boost employee retention.

n this study, we examine the factors that predict 
whether an employee chooses to voluntarily 
leave the federal service. T urnover among U.S.

Thought: I listed and inspected the provided files, read the focal claim and the original paper, loaded and explored the replication CSV, and generated a Python script that reads from /app/data, performs a clustered-robust logistic regression replicating the focal test (negative association between overall job satisfaction and intent to leave one’s agency), and saves outputs to /app/data. The dataset includes variables needed for the focal replication (LeavingAgency, JobSat, and relevant controls) but lacks some of the original controls and the second outcome (LeavingGovernment). I will now provide replication_info.json content reflecting the plan, codebase, and docker specs aligned with Python execution.

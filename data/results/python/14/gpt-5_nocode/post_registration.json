Agency tenure coded as a six-point ordinal scale (1 to 6). Race/ethnicity coded as white=1, nonwhite=0. Satisfaction with benefits factor created from three items (eigenvalue=1.380, Cronbach\u2019s alpha=0.76). Performance culture factor created from four items (eigenvalue=2.407, Cronbach\u2019s alpha=0.87). Supervisor relationship averaged from two items. Gender was missing for nearly 140,000 respondents and was excluded from models."

      "description": "The study examines how demographic, workplace satisfaction, and organizational/relational factors are associated with federal employees\u2019 turnover intentions using 2006 FHCS data. Two binary outcomes capture intentions to leave one\u2019s agency for another federal job or to leave the federal government for an outside position. Logistic regressions with robust standard errors clustered by agency are estimated, including interactions between age and satisfaction with benefits/advancement. Predicted probabilities and first differences are computed via Monte Carlo simulation.",

      "summary": "Overall job satisfaction is a strong, negative predictor of turnover intention for both leaving one\u2019s agency and leaving the federal government. Age exhibits a nonlinear pattern for leaving the agency (middle age groups more likely to intend to move within government; oldest much less likely) and a consistently negative association with leaving government (older employees less likely to intend to leave federal service). Longer agency tenure reduces intentions to leave both the agency and the government. Nonwhite employees are more likely to intend to leave their agency but less likely to intend to leave the federal government compared to white employees. Satisfaction with advancement opportunities reduces turnover intention (stronger effect for leaving the agency), while satisfaction with pay has a small negative effect. Satisfaction with benefits unexpectedly increases intention to leave the agency and is unrelated to intention to leave government. A stronger performance culture slightly increases intention to leave the agency; empowerment has a small negative association with leaving government and no significant effect on leaving the agency. A better supervisor relationship reduces intention to leave the agency; coworker relationship is not significant.",

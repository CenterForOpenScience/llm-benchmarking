  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10 environment with numpy, pandas, statsmodels, and scipy. Started the container, verified the entrypoint and dataset columns, and requested approval to run. First execution failed due to an API call (LogitResults.get_robustcov_results not available); fixed by fitting with cov_type='cluster' and cov_kwds in statsmodels. Re-ran successfully. The logistic regression (Logit) of LeavingAgency on JobSat and controls with cluster-robust SEs by Agency executed on 319,719 observations. Findings align with the preregistered focal hypothesis that higher job satisfaction predicts lower intention to leave; the replicated coefficient is negative and highly significant. Minor deviation: code updated for statsmodels API to compute cluster-robust SEs directly in fit().",

    Study Information
Research Questions
Focal research question(s): Is job satisfaction negatively associated
with employees leaving their agency for another within the federal
government?
Hypotheses
H* (SCORE focal test): Overall job satisfaction makes an employee
less likely to leave across the board.
H* statistical evidence (if relevant): Table 2, Leaving Agency, Job
satisfaction = –0.444, SE = 0.0163, significant at p < .01.
Data Description
Datasets used
Data Sources (used in Pitts):
We test the extent to which these three clusters of factors are
associated with employee turnover intention using data from a
sample more than 200,000 U.S. federal government employees. The
specific data for this study are drawn from the 2006 Federal Human
Capital Is Survey (FHCS) administered by the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management. The data are representative of full-time,
permanent employees on key demographic and geographic (p. 753)
Data Sources (We are going to use):
The Office of Personnel Management Federal Employee Viewpoint
Survey was first administered in 2002 as the Federal Human Capital
Survey (FHCS), and then again in 2004, 2006 and 2008. The FHCS
was renamed the Federal Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey
(FEVS) in 2010 and revised to focus more on actionable items.
Starting in 2010, OPM began administering the OPM FEVS

annually.
Following Pitts, we will use a new wave of 2016 The Office of
Personnel Management Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS).
The survey data is available from https://www.opm.gov/fevs/
public-data-file/. The total of 13 survey waves are currently
available (2006, 2008, and 2010-2020), and our team will use 2016
data.
First, our team is aware that the use of the most recent data is
recommended for DAR analysis (if possible). After our assessment,
our team recognize that 2016 survey data is the most appropriate
survey data. The following outlines our assessment.
2020 FEVS: Dependent variable in the DAR analysis in the original
study is whether or not an employee leaves an agency to another
within the federal government. However, due to Covid-19, FHCS
updated the survey questions regarding the relocation – ask
whether the relocation (leaving the current job) is due to Covid-19.
This was never considered in the original study. Furthermore,
several variables related to work unit are omitted from the survey,
making us not able to construct the following control variables –
‘Satisfaction with benefits’, ‘Satisfaction with advancement’,
‘Performance Culture’, and ‘Empowerment’. For this reason, we
ruled out the 2020 survey.
2017-19 FEVS: Age is not collected in these surveys. Based on the
regression model, our team find that ‘age’ is one of the key
demographic control variables, so we ruled out 2017-19 surveys for
this reason.

Measured variables

Dependent variable
Original Paper: Leaving Agency
At its most basic level, turnover intention is measured as whether
an employee intends to leave the organization. In the FHCS, the
relevant question is, "Are you considering leaving your organization
within the next year, and if so, why?" We create two dependent
variables from the responses to this question. We first measure
turnover intention as a dichotomous variable, where 1 represents
those who plan to leave their agency to take another job within the
federal government, and 0 represents all others. We label this
variable "Leaving Agency" in the tables… (page 753).
The question #83 of the 2006 Survey:
83. Are you considering leaving your organization within the next
year, and if so, why?
[A] No
[B] Yes, to retire
[C] Yes, to take another job within the Federal Government
[D] Yes, to take another job outside the Federal Government
[E] Yes, other
DAR: Leaving Agency (‘LeavingAgency’)
Using ‘DLEAVING’ (Are you considering leaving your organization
within the next year, and if so, why? A-No; B-Yes, to take another
Federal job; C-Yes, to take a job outside Federal Gov; D-Other), our
team will construct the dependent variable.
Independent variables

Original Paper: Job Satisfaction
“…responses to a measure of overall job satisfaction: "Considering
everything, how satisfied are you with your job?” (p. 754)
The question #60 of the 2006 Survey:
60. Considering everything, how satisfied are you with your job?
5 "Very Satisfied"
4 "Satisfied"
3 "Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied"
2 "Dissatisfied"
1 "Very Dissatisfied"
DAR: Job Satisfaction (‘JobSat’)
Our team will use ‘Q69’ (Considering everything, how satisfied are
you with your job? 5-Very Satisfied; 4-Satisfied; 3-Neither Satisfied
nor Dissatisfied; 2-Dissatisfied; 1-Very Dissatisfied) to construct ‘Job
Satisfaction’.
Control variables
Original Paper: Age
“The FHCS asked employees to categorize their age as under 30,
30-39, 40-49, 50-59, or 60 and over. We use these responses to
create a series of dummy variables, one for each of the age
categories.”. (p. 754)
DAR: Age (‘Over40’)
Using ‘DAGEGRP’ (What is your age group? A-Under 40; B-40 and
Older), our team will create a dummy indicating whether the
survey respondent is 40 or older (=1). Our replication team
recognizes that this deviation from the original study will reduce

the number of age categories from 5 to 2. However, it was
inevitable due to data unavailability.
Original Paper: Agency Tenure
“For agency tenure, employees were asked to categorize how long
they had been with their agency on a six-point scale.” (p. 754)
DAR: Agency Tenure
This survey does not ask respondents any question related to
tenure, so we will not have this control variable in the DAR
analysis.
Original Paper: Race/ethnicity
“For race/ethnicity, we code white as 1 and nonwhite as 0.” (p.
754)
DAR: Race/ethnicity (‘NonMinority’)
Using ‘DMINORITY’ (Minority status (coded from DRNO and
DHISP). 1-Minority; 2-Non-Minority), our team will create a dummy
indicating whether the respondent is Non-minority (=1).
Note: Minority Status (DMINORITY): A combination of the race/
national origin and the ethnicity demographics. Those who identify
as both White and Non-Hispanic are coded as “Non-minority” and
all other combination of responses are coded as “Minority.”
Original Paper: Satisfaction with Pay
“Employees were asked, "Considering everything, how satisfied are
you with your pay?" (p. 754)
DAR: Satisfaction with Pay (‘SatPay’)

Our team will use ‘Q70’ (Considering everything, how satisfied are
you with your pay?5-Very Satisfied; 4-Satisfied; 3-Neither Satisfied
nor Dissatisfied; 2-Dissatisfied; 1-Very Dissatisfied) to construct
‘Satisfaction with Pay’.
Original Paper: Satisfaction with Benefits
“For satisfaction with benefits, we use factor analysis to combine
three questions: "How satisfied are you with retirement benefits?,"
"How satisfied are you with health insurance benefits?," and "How
satisfied are you with life insurance benefits?" The variables load
onto one factor with an eigenvalue of 1.380, and Cronbach's alpha
is 0.76.” (p. 754)
DAR: Satisfaction with Benefits
This survey does not ask respondents any question related to
employees benefits, so we will not have this control variable in the
DAR analysis.
Original Paper: Satisfaction with Advancement
For advancement opportunity, we use data from the question, "How
satisfied are you with your opportunity to get a better job in your
organization?” (p. 754)
DAR: Satisfaction with Advancement (‘SatAdvan’)
Our team will use ‘Q67’ (How satisfied are you with your
opportunity to get a better job in your organization? 5-Very
Satisfied; 4-Satisfied; 3-Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied; 2-
Dissatisfied; 1-Very Dissatisfied) to construct ‘Satisfaction with
Advancement’.
Original Paper: Performance Culture
“To measure performance culture, we combine responses to four

questions: "Promotions in my work unit are based on merit,"
"Employees are rewarded for providing high quality products and
services to customers," "Pay raises depend on how well employees
perform their jobs," and
"Awards in my work unit depend on how well employees perform
their jobs." All four load onto one factor, with an eigenvalue of
2.407 and a Cronbach's alpha of 0.87.” (p. 754)
DAR: Performance Culture (‘PerfCul’)
Our team will use Q22 (Promotions in my work unit are based on
merit), Q31 (Employees are rewarded for providing high quality
products and services to customers), Q33 (Pay raises depend on
how well employees perform their jobs), and Q25 (Awards in my
work unit depend on how well employees perform their jobs) to
create this control variable.
All the four variables (Q22, Q31, Q33, and Q25) have the following
scale - 5-Very Satisfied; 4-Satisfied; 3-Neither Satisfied nor
Dissatisfied; 2-Dissatisfied; 1-Very Dissatisfied.
The corresponding eigenvalue is 3.01 ( =1.74 * 1.74 ) and a
Cronbach’s alpha is 0.88.
Our team construct this variable by using principal component via
‘prcomp’ command in R. We first standardize all the four variables
and employ the principal component. The Cronbach’s alpha is
computed by the function, ‘reliability’ in ‘umx’ package in R.
Original Paper: Empowerment
“To measure empowerment, we use data from the question,
"Employees have a feeling of personal empowerment with respect to
work processes." (p. 754)
DAR: Empowerment (‘Empowerment’)
Our team will use ‘Q30’ (Employees have a feeling of personal

empowerment with respect to work processes. 5-Very Satisfied; 4-
Satisfied; 3-Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied; 2-Dissatisfied; 1-Very
Dissatisfied) to construct ‘Satisfaction with Advancement’.
Original Paper: Relationship with Supervisor
“For supervisors, we use the average from two questions: "I have
trust and confidence in my supervisor" and "Overall, how good a job
do you feel is being done by your immediate supervisor?"” (p. 754)
DAR: Relationship with Supervisor (‘RelSup’)
Our team will use ‘Q51’ (I have trust and confidence in my
supervisor. 5-Very Satisfied; 4-Satisfied; 3-Neither Satisfied nor
Dissatisfied; 2-Dissatisfied; 1-Very Dissatisfied) and ‘Q52’ (Overall,
how good a job do you feel is being done by your immediate
supervisor? 5-Very Good; 4-Good; 3-Fair; 2-Poor; 1-Very Poor) to
construct ‘Relationship with Supervisor’.
Following the original study, we construct the variable, ‘RelSup’, by
taking the average of the two - Q51 and Q52 - variables.
Original Paper: Relationship with coworkers
For coworkers, we use the question, "The people I work with
cooperate to get the job done." (p. 754)
DAR: Relationship with coworkers (‘Relcow’)
Our team will use ‘Q20’ (The people I work with cooperate to get
the job done. 5-Very Satisfied; 4-Satisfied; 3-Neither Satisfied nor
Dissatisfied; 2-Dissatisfied; 1-Very Dissatisfied) to construct
‘Relationship with coworkers’.
Unit of analysis
The original paper “The data are representative of full-time,
permanent employees…”. (p. 753) Total of 217,504 observations

are used for the analysis in the original study (Table 2, Leaving
Agency, Observations).
The original 2016 survey dataset has 407,789 observations. After
excluding observations with missing values, there will be 319,719
observations available for the DAR analysis.
In particular, we applied a listwise deletion process to get the final
set of observations - we remove rows (observations) if one or more
relevant variables (relevant to analysis) are missing.
Missing data
Based on the 2016 survey dataset, there are two types of missing
values. It appears that if a respondent did not answer, no value is
reported. If a question is not applicable to the respondent, the value
‘X’ is reported.
Our team will treat both cases as missing, and they will be excluded
from the DAR analysis (listwise deletion).
The original 2016 survey dataset has 407,789 observations. After
excluding observations with missing values, there will be 319,719
observations available for the DAR analysis.
Original paper did not mention how they dealt with missing values.
Statistical outliers
Our team checked all the variables, and found that all the variables
are within the range of 5 (very satisfied) to 1 (Very Dissatisfied).
And, therefore our team will not remove any data due to outlying
values.
Sampling weights

Not Applicable.
Knowledge Of Data
Prior Publication/Dissemination
Not Applicable.
Prior knowledge
Before we do the 5% sample analysis in section Statistical models
and power calculation in section Statistical power, none of our team
(the replication team) previously worked with this dataset.
However, to fill the Section Statistical models and Statistical power,
our team used the dataset.
The 5% random sample analysis is required not only for the Section
Statistical models but also for the executive summary which we will
fill later. For section Statistical power, to calculate the power, we
employed the half blind strategy - only attained estimated standard
error of focal coefficient from the full sample estimation results
without looking at it (e.g., just pull out the standard error without
printing the full estimation results).
Analyses
Statistical models
For the purposes of SCORE, to test H* and attempt to replicate the
H* statistical evidence (if relevant), we will follow the original
paper, use logit regression model with robust clustered (agency)
standard errors.
Following the original paper, we study the relationship between
‘Leaving agency’ and ‘Job Satisfaction’.

Deviation from the original study:
The two variables, ‘Agency Tenure’ and ‘Satisfaction with Benefits’
(and its interaction with age variable) are omitted from the analysis
due to data unavailability (see section Measured variables).
Effect size
Not applicable. Since it is logistic model estimation, the coefficient
of interest may have any real number. However, if the original
study’s result is robust, we expect to have a negative coefficient
with statistical significance.
Statistical power
Our team estimated the power from (1) the standard error
estimated from the full sample estimation and (2) the estimated
effect reported in the original paper. The below is our assessment
results. This paper passes the Threshold, Stage 1, Stage 2 power
requirement.
Inference criteria
[Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project
is a statistically significant effect (alpha = .05, two tailed) in the
same pattern as the original study on the focal statistical evidence
(H*). For this study, the coefficient JobSat is negative and the
corresponding p value is less than 0.05 (two tailed).
Assumption Violation/ Model Non-Convergence
Not Applicable.
Reliability and Robustness testing
Not Applicable.

Exploratory analysis
Not Applicable.

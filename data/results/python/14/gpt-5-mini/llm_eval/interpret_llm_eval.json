  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The summary provides a detailed narrative of the replication process, including the hypothesis and execution issues. However, it lacks specific numerical comparisons or outcomes due to the execution failure."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 0,
    "explanation": "The execution status is correctly identified as 'Failure' due to the inability to run the replication script and produce results."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The method alignment is mostly similar to the reference. It describes the use of a logistic regression model and notes the absence of Monte Carlo simulations, which were optional. The core methodology aligns with the preregistration."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].issue_description": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The issue description of the execution entrypoint mismatch is an exact match with the reference, clearly identifying the problem with the orchestrator attempting to run the wrong script."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].impact": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The impact of the execution entrypoint mismatch is accurately described as high, preventing any code from running and producing no estimation output."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The data/sample-size discrepancy is mostly similar to the reference. It identifies a significant difference in sample size, which could affect results, but lacks specific details on how this was addressed."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact is mostly similar, noting a medium effect due to potential differences in coefficient magnitudes and standard errors, but it lacks specific resolution steps."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The absence of Clarify/Monte-Carlo simulations is mostly similar to the reference, noting it as optional and affecting substantive interpretation but not primary results."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact is mostly similar, indicating a low-to-medium effect on interpretation but not on primary results, aligning with the optional nature of the simulations."
  },

    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis tested is an exact match with the reference, clearly stating the relationship between job satisfaction and the intention to leave."

    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The original results are an exact match with the reference, including the coefficient, significance level, and substantive interpretation."
  },
  "results_comparison.replication_results": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The replication results accurately reflect the failure to produce any results due to execution issues, matching the reference."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The overall answer is an exact match, correctly stating that the replication cannot be judged due to the lack of produced estimates."

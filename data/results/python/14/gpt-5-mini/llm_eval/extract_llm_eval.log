You are an information verifier. The task you're concerned with is extracting important information about a main claim in a research paper.
You are given TWO json objects: one extracted and one reference, your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the extraced JSON object based on the (key, value pair) presented in the reference JSON object.

=== END OF EXPLANATION OF WHAT EACH FIELD IN THE JSON MEAN ===

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The extracted information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the paper. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelated information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The extracted information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The extracted information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely. 

For fields where the reference is "not stated" or "NA", assign a score of 3 as long as the extracted information reflect similar meaning: "not available", "not stated", etc.

Age shows a nuanced pattern: middle-age groups are more likely than the youngest group to intend to leave their agency (for another federal job), whereas increases in age consistently reduce the likelihood of intending to leave the federal government for an outside job. Satisfaction with advancement strongly reduces intention to leave one's agency. Satisfaction with pay has a small negative relationship with turnover intention. Satisfaction with benefits is unexpectedly positively related to intention to leave one's agency and unrelated to leaving government. Performance culture is positively associated with 'Leaving Agency' (suggesting performance culture may encourage intra-government mobility or exit), empowerment has small or nonsignificant effects, and a positive relationship with one's supervisor reduces intention to leave the agency. Many coefficients are statistically significant at p < .01. Predicted probability simulations quantify substantive effects (e.g., a one standard deviation increase in job satisfaction corresponds to ~5 percentage point decrease in probability of intending to leave one's agency).",

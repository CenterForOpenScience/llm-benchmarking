This match is documented in the replication CSV header (data/original/14/0205_python_gpt5-mini/replication_data/Estimation Data - Pitts (126zz).csv) and the original study's methods/results described in post_registration.json and original_paper.pdf (see post_registration.json \"method\" and \"data\" sections referencing the same variables).",

(2) The replication data file name and structure differ from the original R script: the R script expects 'DAR data for 126zz.csv' and sets a working directory placeholder, whereas the actual provided CSV is named 'Estimation Data - Pitts (126zz).csv' (files present in data/original/14/0205_python_gpt5-mini/replication_data/).

Missingness is handled via complete-case (na.omit in the original R) and the Python script mirrors that by dropna(); this may change the effective sample size relative to the packaged CSV. The original paper used Stata and Clarify for predicted-probability simulation; the replication Python script performs coefficient estimation and clustered SEs but does not perform the Clarify-style Monte Carlo simulations unless requested. Clustering by Agency relies on 'Agency' identifiers in the CSV; ensure Agency has a reasonable number of clusters (not a single cluster) for valid clustered SEs. If Agency IDs are categorical strings, clustering will still be applied but statsmodels expects group labels as an array (script handles this)."

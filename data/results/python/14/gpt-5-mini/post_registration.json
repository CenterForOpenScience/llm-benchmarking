      "description": "The study analyzes determinants of turnover intention using responses from the 2006 FHCS. Two binary dependent variables are created from the survey question on considering leaving the organization: (1) intention to leave agency for another federal job ('Leaving Agency') and (2) intention to leave the federal government for an outside job ('Leaving Government'). Independent variables are organized into three clusters (demographic; workplace satisfaction; organizational/relational). Factor analysis constructs multi-item scales (e.g., satisfaction with benefits, performance culture). The authors estimate logistic regression (logit) models with robust standard errors clustered by agency and report unstandardized coefficients. They use Monte Carlo simulations via King, Tomz, and Wittenberg\u2019s Clarify program in Stata 11 to compute predicted probabilities and first differences for substantive interpretation.",
      "steps": "1) Obtain 2006 FHCS data (full-time, permanent federal employees). 2) Create two binary dependent variables from the FHCS question 'Are you considering leaving your organization within the next year, and if so, why?' \u2014 code 'Leaving Agency' and 'Leaving Government' as described. 3) Code independent variables: age categories (under 30, 30\u201339, 40\u201349, 50\u201359, 60+), agency tenure (six-point ordinal), race/ethnicity (white=1, nonwhite=0), job satisfaction and other satisfaction items (1\u20135), empowerment and relationship items. 4) Conduct factor analysis to combine benefit-related questions and performance-culture items; compute factor scores (paper reports eigenvalues and Cronbach's alphas). 5) Specify logistic regression models for each dependent variable with independent variables from the three clusters, include interaction terms between age and satisfaction with benefits and advancement. 6) Estimate models using logit with robust standard errors clustered by agency. 7) Use Monte Carlo simulations (Clarify in Stata 11) to generate predicted probabilities and first differences holding other variables at means. 8) Report coefficients, standard errors, significance, predicted probabilities, and substantive first differences.",

      "summary": "Workplace satisfaction (overall job satisfaction) is the strongest predictor of turnover intention, with higher job satisfaction associated with lower intention to leave both the agency and the federal government. Age shows a nuanced pattern: middle-age groups are more likely than the youngest group to intend to leave their agency (for another federal job), whereas increases in age consistently reduce the likelihood of intending to leave the federal government for an outside job. Satisfaction with advancement strongly reduces intention to leave one's agency. Satisfaction with pay has a small negative relationship with turnover intention. Satisfaction with benefits is unexpectedly positively related to intention to leave one's agency and unrelated to leaving government. Performance culture is positively associated with 'Leaving Agency' (suggesting performance culture may encourage intra-government mobility or exit), empowerment has small or nonsignificant effects, and a positive relationship with one's supervisor reduces intention to leave the agency. Many coefficients are statistically significant at p < .01. Predicted probability simulations quantify substantive effects (e.g., a one standard deviation increase in job satisfaction corresponds to ~5 percentage point decrease in probability of intending to leave one's agency).",

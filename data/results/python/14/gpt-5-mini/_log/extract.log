Turnover among U.S. Federal Employees 751
New Thinking 
about Motivating 
Public Employees
So Hard to Say Goodbye? T urnover Intention among U.S. 
Federal Employees
Why do U.S. federal government employees choose 
to leave the federal service? By focusing on turnover 
intentions, this article develops propositions about why 
employees anticipate leaving their jobs along three 
dimensions: (1) demographic factors, (2) workplace 
satisfaction factors, and (3) organizational/relational 
factors. Two distinct measures of turnover intention 
are advanced that reﬂ  ect those who intend to leave 
their agency for another position within the federal 
government and those who intend to leave the federal 
government for an outside position. Th e 2006 Federal 
Human Capital Survey is used to test the impacts of three 
clusters of independent variables on these measures of 
turnover intention. Th e ﬁ ndings suggest that overall job 
satisfaction and age aﬀ ect turnover consistently. Practical 
recommendations are outlined for public managers 
seeking to boost employee retention.
I
n this study, we examine the factors that predict 
whether an employee chooses to voluntarily 
leave the federal service. T urnover among U.S. 
federal government employees 
has been a consistent con-
cern for at least the past 20 
years. During the 1980s, fears 
that antigovernment senti-
ment, declining relative pay 
for federal employees, and 
initiatives aimed at downsizing 
the federal bureaucracy were 
hindering government’s ability to hire and retain 
skilled workers led the Volcker Commission to warn 
of a “quiet crisis” in the federal civil service. By 
2000, Congress and the George W . Bush adminis-
tration began sounding the alarm of an impending 
“human capital crisis” that would involve massive 
turnover and retirement. Studies by the Govern-
ment Accountability Oﬃ  ce (formerly the General 
Accounting Oﬃ  ce) and congressional hearings led 
by Senator George V .  Voinovich and Representa-
tive Joe Scarborough cited dire shortages of skilled 
employees in the Departments of Defense and State 
(GAO 2001; U.S. Senate 2000). In response to 
these developments, the Bush  administration made 
employee recruitment and retention a priority by 
requiring agencies to develop human capital strate-
gies and evaluation plans.
Job turnover has become such a pressing issue, in part, 
because of the serious consequences that it creates for 
managers. In addition to creating turmoil and causing 
disruptions in service delivery, turnover imposes con-
siderable costs on organizations: separation costs such 
as severance pay, as well as replacement costs, including 
the cost of hiring, screening, and training new employ-
ees. Th e average turnover costs for a full-time profes-
sional employee in the private sector have been esti-
mated to be as high as 150 percent of the employee’s 
annual compensation package (Schlesinger and Heskett 
1991). While it seems intuitive that some turnover can 
be a positive inﬂ uence on performance, the bulk of 
the literature suggests that organizations with greater 
personnel stability perform better than those with 
less stability (Meier and Hicklin 2008; O’T oole and 
Meier 2003; but see Abelson and 
 Baysinger 1984).
Public administration research-
ers have begun to explore the 
determinants of turnover in 
public organizations. Most of 
these studies have focused on 
the organization as the unit 
of analysis, identifying a number of factors related 
to turnover, including opportunities for internal 
advancement, provision of on-site day care and other 
family-friendly policies, unionization, average work-
force age, and percentage of employees working full 
time (Durst 1999; Selden and Moynihan 2000). Th is 
study seeks to expand the understanding of turnover 
in the federal government by taking a deeper look 
at how turnover intention operates at the individual 
employee level. Speciﬁ cally, we examine how the 
demographic characteristics of employees, employee 
attitudes, and employee perceptions of management 
and coworkers inﬂ uence  turnover intention. Using

research from organization theory and public administration as a 
foundation, we develop a model of turnover intention and test it 
using data on U.S. federal employees.
Determinants of Employee Turnover
A growing body of research in both organiza-
tion theory and public administration points 
to a number of common factors frequently 
associated with turnover. Previous studies have 
found turnover to be a function of organi-
zational characteristics, economic and labor 
market conditions, demographic characteris-
tics of employees, employee job satisfaction, 
and employee perceptions of management 
and the work environment (Cotton and T uttle 
1986; Kellough and Osuna 1995; Lambert, 
Hogan, and Barton 2001; Lewis 1991; Mobley et al. 1979). Our 
analysis organizes these factors into three clusters, which we will 
discuss in turn: demographic factors, workplace satisfaction factors, 
and organizational/relational factors.
Demographic Factors
Demographic characteristics appear to strongly inﬂ uence employee 
decisions to exit an organization. For example, older workers are 
less likely than younger ones to intend to leave an organization. 
Younger employees have higher quit rates as a result of shift-
ing career paths, greater willingness to relocate, and fewer family 
responsibilities and ﬁ nancial obligations (Kellough and Osuna 
1995; Lewis 1991; Meyer et al. 1979). Generational diﬀ erences 
also encourage younger employees to change jobs and sector of 
employment frequently after earning their degrees (Stark 2007). 
For example, recent public policy graduates are more likely than 
those from older generations to go between the public and private 
sectors (Chetkovich 2003). In addition, the draw of the federal 
service historically has been the stability of employment and the 
generous beneﬁ ts plans that were oﬀ ered. As Generations X and Y 
put less stock in stability and beneﬁ ts, there is a greater likelihood 
of turnover among those groups because those who are drawn to 
the federal service are not likely to stay in order to take advantage 
of the job security and nonpecuniary beneﬁ ts that government jobs 
oﬀ er (see, e.g., Lewis and Frank 2002).
Job tenure also appears to have a strong negative inﬂ uence on 
turnover (Blau and Kahn 1981; Cotton and T uttle 1986; Lambert, 
Hogan, and Barton 2001; Lewis 1991; Sørensen 2000). T urnover is 
greatest at the earliest stages of employment, but it declines rapidly 
over the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve years and then more slowly up to about 15 years 
of service (Lewis 1991). A principal explanation for this trend is that 
social interaction in the workplace tends to engender aﬃ  nity and 
loyalty toward the organization and its members, thus reducing the 
propensity for turnover (Sørensen 2000). Th is reﬂ ects Hirschman’s 
(1970) classic theory of exit, voice, or loyalty. As an employee re-
mains with an organization over time, he or she will be motivated 
to respond to changes within it by exiting, voicing concern, or 
remaining loyal. Practically speaking, federal government agen-
cies often incentivize a version of “loyalty” by providing retirement 
beneﬁ ts that grow substantially as employees put more time into the 
system (Ippolito 1987). Once an employee has a certain number 
of years of experience in federal employment, he or she may refrain 
from leaving or retiring early out of consideration for the potential 
loss in retirement earnings.
A third demographic factor in turnover is employee race/ethnic-
ity, but research is inconsistent as to whether nonwhite employees 
are more or less likely than whites to exit. 
Blau and Kahn (1981) found that African 
Americans quit less frequently than whites 
with similar personal and job characteristics 
because of shorter expected job tenure and 
weaker labor force attachment in private ﬁ rms 
(see also Zax 1989). However, Kellough and 
Osuna (1995) found no signiﬁ cant relation-
ship between race/ethnicity and quit rates 
across federal agencies. While early work 
on turnover focused on the direct eﬀ ects of 
demographic variables on turnover, Lambert, Hogan, and Barton 
(2001) argued that demographic variables have indirect eﬀ ects on 
turnover through job satisfaction. Choi (2009) tested the relation-
ships between race/ethnicity, diversity management, and turnover, 
ﬁ nding that although nonwhite employees were more likely to in-
tend to leave than white employees, diversity management programs 
did not moderate the relationship.
Workplace Satisfaction Factors
Job satisfaction has been a dominant theme in turnover research. 
A large body of empirical research indicates a consistent and inverse 
relationship between overall job satisfaction and turnover (Carsten 
and Spector 1987; Cotton and T uttle 1986; Lambert, Hogan, and 
Barton 2001; Mobley et al. 1979; Porter and Steers 1973). Impor-
tantly, dissatisfaction with pay is among the strongest predictors of 
employee quit propensity (Blau and Kahn 1981; Cotton and T uttle 
1986; Lambert, Hogan, and Barton 2001; Park, Ofori-Dankwa, and 
Bishop 1994; Shaw et al. 1998). High pay reduces quit rates because 
employees maximize their own self-interest through staying (Shaw, 
et al., 1998). Higher wages also reduce incentives to search and the 
probability of ﬁ nding a better-paying job (Blau and Kahn 1981). 
Finally, higher wages can lessen an employee’s level of anxiety about 
his or her ﬁ nancial state and enhance perceived self-worth to the 
organization (Lambert, Hogan, and Barton 2001).
Satisfaction with beneﬁ ts is also important in the context of gov-
ernment, where beneﬁ ts historically have provided a comparative 
recruitment advantage over other sectors. Generous retirement and 
health care beneﬁ ts can reduce turnover (Shaw et al. 1998), and the 
threat of losing pension beneﬁ ts because of early departure can dis-
courage employees from leaving government jobs (Ippolito 1987). 
Th e scope and ﬂ exibility of beneﬁ t options are also important 
because of the increasing participation of women in the labor mar-
ket, the increasing number of dual-career families, and rising living 
costs, particularly for medical care (Williams and Dreher 1992).
Satisfaction with opportunities for career growth and promotion 
also has been found to negatively inﬂ uence voluntary turnover 
 (Cotton and T uttle 1986; Griﬀ eth, Hom, and Gaertner 2000; 
Porter and Steers 1973; Spector 1985). Mobley et al. (1979) argued 
that dissatisﬁ ed employees evaluate the expected utility of a job 
search and the cost of quitting, then decide whether they will stay 
or quit. Employees also compare their promotion opportunities and

decide to remain or leave for preferable alternatives based on their 
perceptions of equity (Porter and Steers 1973). Promotion leads to 
higher levels of satisfaction, organizational commitment, intrinsic 
motivation, and job involvement, lowering the probability of exit 
(Johnston et al. 1993). Moreover, promotion typically is accompa-
nied by a wage increase, which is likely to reduce turnover (Johnston 
et al. 1993). Satisfaction with opportunities for advancement may 
be particularly relevant in the case of the U.S. federal government, 
where expectations and criteria for promotion tend to be more 
transparent than in private or nonproﬁ t organizations with more 
ambiguous position descriptions.
Organizational/Relational Factors
A series of factors related to the organization and an employee’s 
relationships with others also have been found to inﬂ uence turnover. 
For example, public management reforms related to performance 
are argued to boost employee satisfaction, productivity, and reten-
tion. Th e standard argument behind performance-based pay has 
been that employees who are not rewarded for doing a good job will 
not be incentivized to work hard or to progress to the next level in 
their careers (Kellough and Lu 1993). Th ose employees may leave 
the  organization and perhaps the federal government more broadly 
as they see poor performers rewarded at the same level as high 
performers. On the other hand, poor performers may be more com-
fortable with an organization that does not diﬀ erentiate between 
employees who perform at diﬀ erent levels, which would make them 
less likely to leave. Th erefore, it is diﬃ  cult to predict whether the net 
impact of performance-based initiatives will be positive or negative.
Further complicating matters is the possibility that extrinsic reward 
systems such as performance-based pay will “crowd out” employees’ 
intrinsic motivation. Perry and Wise (1990) raised this idea in the 
public administration literature when they suggested that “utilitar-
ian” incentive structures might not be appropriate for public organi-
zations, as those organizations’ employees will be motivated more 
by public service ideals than monetary rewards. Outside public 
administration, Frey and colleagues (e.g., Frey 1997; Frey and Jegen 
2001; Frey and Oberholzer-Gee 1997) have devoted considerable 
eﬀ ort to developing and testing “motivation crowding theory.” Frey 
and Gotte (1999), for instance, showed that when ﬁ nancial rewards 
are provided to volunteers, their work eﬀ ort decreases signiﬁ cantly. 
Additionally, Frey and Oberholzer-Gee (1997) adduced evidence 
suggesting that individuals are less likely to support the locating 
of NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) projects (i.e., projects such as 
prisons or airports that increase overall social welfare but impose 
costs on those who live near them) when they are oﬀ ered monetary 
compensation. More generally, Frey and colleagues argue that pay-
for-performance systems will not necessarily work in the way they 
are intended—that is, to spur work eﬀ ort and productivity. For our 
purposes, their arguments imply that the existence of such systems 
(or, more broadly, the existence of a “performance culture”) in pub-
lic organizations may induce turnover rather than curtail it.
Since the 1980s, public agencies and private ﬁ rms increasingly have 
been relying on participative management techniques and employee 
empowerment practices aimed at sharing authority, information, and 
resources with frontline employees in order to improve performance 
(Bowen and Lawler 1992, 1995; Kim 2002; Lawler, Mohrman, and 
Ledford 1995; Peters 1996). Eﬀ ective participation is theorized to 
enhance retention by signaling to employees that their eﬀ orts are 
valued (Griﬀ eth, Hom, and Gaertner 2000; Huselid 1995;  Lambert, 
Hogan, and Barton 2001; Shaw et al. 1998). Participation also 
encourages employee’s self-identity and creates a sense of obligation 
to support organizational goals (Allen, Shore, and Griﬀ eth 2003). 
From a psychological perspective, empowerment is a process leading 
to an internal cognitive state characterized by increased intrinsic task 
motivation (Th omas and Velthouse 1990) and enhanced feelings of 
self-eﬃ  cacy (Conger and Kanungo 1988). Empirical ﬁ ndings show 
that empowerment can improve productivity, raise levels of employee 
satisfaction and organizational commitment, promote job involve-
ment, and encourage innovativeness (Guthrie 2001; Kirkman and 
Rosen 1999; Lawler, Mohrman, and Ledford, 1992, 1995; Spreitzer 
1995). Th ere is good reason to believe, therefore, that employees who 
feel empowered will be less likely to leave.
Other employee relationships with management and coworkers 
also should help account for turnover. Studies consistently have 
shown that an employee’s satisfaction with his or her relationships 
with other employees and supervisor is negatively associated with 
turnover (Cotton and T uttle 1986; Griﬀ eth, Hom, and Gaertner 
2000; Lambert, Hogan, and Barton 2001). Scot et al. (1999) found 
that communication with supervisors and coworkers alleviated 
intent to leave. Th ey argued that open and frequent communication 
lowers turnover by “reducing the uncertainty and equivocality” and 
by reinforcing worker’s feelings of identiﬁ cation with the organiza-
tion. Costigan, Ilter, and Berman (1998) also maintained that trust 
in a supervisor is negatively related to intention to leave voluntarily. 
Th is work echoes leadership research showing that high-exchange 
relationships between leaders and followers involving high levels 
of mutual trust result in higher subordinate satisfaction, stronger 
organizational commitment by the subordinate, and higher subor-
dinate performance (Bass 1990; Graen and Scandura 1987; Graen 
and Uhl-Bien 1991; see also Yukl 2002). A high level of trust and 
conﬁ dence in a supervisor may result in broad grants of discretion 
and increase the likelihood of receiving desirable rewards, thereby 
decreasing the likelihood of exit.
Data and Measurement
We test the extent to which these three clusters of factors are associ-
ated with employee turnover intention using data from a sample of 
more than 200,000 U.S. federal government employees. Th e speciﬁ c 
data for this study are drawn from the 2006 Federal Human Capital 
Survey (FHCS) administered by the U.S. Oﬃ  ce of Personnel 
Management. Th e data are representative of full-time, permanent 
employees on key demographic and geographic indicators.
Dependent Variables
Our outcome of interest is turnover intention, a common surrogate 
for actual turnover in public administration research (Bertelli 2007; 
Kim 2005). Data limitations prevent us from predicting actual 
turnover, but research has demonstrated that turnover intention 
and actual turnover are highly and positively correlated ( Dalton, 
Johnson, and Daily 1999; Steele and Ovalle 1984; T ett and Meyer 
1993). At its most basic level, turnover intention is measured as 
whether an employee intends to leave the organization. In the 
FHCS, the relevant question is, “Are you considering leaving your 
organization within the next year, and if so, why?” We create two 
dependent variables from the responses to this question.
1
754 Public Administration Review  September | October 2011
We ﬁ rst measure turnover intention as a dichotomous variable, 
where 1 represents those who plan to leave their agency to take 
 another job within the federal government, and 0 represents all 
others. We label this variable “Leaving Agency” in the tables, and 
we ﬁ nd that roughly 16.1 percent of employees plan to leave for 
 another federal job. Our second measure of turnover intention 
 focuses on the intention to leave the federal government for an 
 outside position. For this measure, 1 represents those who plan to 
leave their agency for a job outside the federal government, and 0 
represents all others. We label this variable “Leaving Government” 
in the tables, and we ﬁ nd that roughly 3.6 percent of employees 
plan to leave their jobs for an outside position. We omit those 
 planning to retire, as the factors that predict retirement are likely 
diﬀ erent from those that predict turnover for another job.
Independent Variables
T o examine the factors that inﬂ uence turnover intention, we include 
three clusters of independent variables in our model, the ﬁ rst being 
demographic factors. Th e FHCS asked employees to categorize 
their age as under 30, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, or 60 and over. We 
use these responses to create a series of dummy variables, one for 
each of the age categories. Th e largest group of employees is 50–59 
years old (39.3 percent), followed by 40–49 (33.4 percent), 30–39 
(14.2 percent), and 60 and older (9.1 percent). Only 4.0 percent are 
under the age of 30. Th ere are descriptive diﬀ erences between these 
groups in turnover intention. Between 21 percent and 23 percent 
of employees in the youngest three age groups report planning to 
leave their jobs for another job within federal government, a ﬁ gure 
that decreases to 15 percent for the 50–59 age group and to 6 
percent for those over age 60. Propensity to leave for a job outside 
the federal government decreases with age, moving from 9 percent 
in the youngest age group to 2 percent in the oldest. For agency 
tenure, employees were asked to categorize how long they had been 
with their agency on a six-point scale. Th e resulting frequencies are 
0.1 percent, less than one year; 2.8 percent, 1–3 years; 1.9 percent, 
4–5 years; 3.9 percent, 6–10 years; 75.5 percent, 11–20 years; and 
15.9 percent, more than 20 years. We assign a value of 1 to the ﬁ rst 
group and 6 to the last, treating this as an ordinal variable in our 
analysis.
2 For race/ethnicity, we code white as 1 and nonwhite as 
0, ﬁ nding that just under 70 percent of employees in our sample 
consider themselves white.3 Descriptive statistics for all variables are 
reported in table 1.
We also test variables related to workplace satisfaction, the ﬁ rst being 
responses to a measure of overall job satisfaction: “Considering every-
thing, how satisﬁ ed are you with your job?” Response options included 
“very satisﬁ ed” (21.3 percent), “satisﬁ ed” (46.8 percent), “neither satis-
ﬁ ed nor dissatisﬁ ed” (17.2 percent), “dissatisﬁ ed” (10.3 percent), and 
“very dissatisﬁ ed” (4.4 percent). Employees also were asked, “Consid-
ering everything, how satisﬁ ed are you with your pay?” Th e results here 
are slightly less positive: 17.8 percent are very satisﬁ ed, 47.6 percent 
are satisﬁ ed, 16.6 percent are neutral, 13.2 percent are dissatisﬁ ed, and 
4.8 percent are very dissatisﬁ ed. For satisfaction with beneﬁ ts, we use 
factor analysis to combine three questions: “How satisﬁ ed are you with 
retirement beneﬁ ts?,” “How satisﬁ ed are you with health insurance 
beneﬁ ts?,” and “How satisﬁ ed are you with life insurance beneﬁ ts?” 
Th e variables load onto one factor with an eigenvalue of 1.380, and 
the Cronbach’s alpha is 0.76. For advancement opportunity, we use 
data from the question, “How satisﬁ ed are you with your opportunity 
to get a better job in your organization?” Nine percent report being 
very satisﬁ ed; 28.5 percent, satisﬁ ed; 29.9 percent, neutral; 19.9 
percent, dissatisﬁ ed; and 12.5 percent, very dissatisﬁ ed.
Our next set of variables includes organizational/relationship factors. 
T o measure empowerment, we use data from the question, “Employ-
ees have a feeling of personal empowerment with respect to work 
processes.” On this question, 7.6 percent strongly agree, 37.9 percent 
agree, 29.7 percent are neutral, 16.6 percent disagree, and 8.1 per-
cent strongly disagree. T o measure performance culture, we combine 
responses to four questions: “Promotions in my work unit are based 
on merit,” “Employees are rewarded for providing high quality 
products and services to customers,” “Pay raises depend on how well 
employees perform their jobs,” and “Awards in my work unit depend 
on how well employees perform their jobs.” All four load onto one 
factor, with an eigenvalue of 2.407 and a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.87. 
We also include two measures related to relationships with supervi-
sors and coworkers. For coworkers, we use the question, “Th e people 
I work with cooperate to get the job done.” Th e responses are very 
positive: 32.3 percent strongly agree, 52.9 percent agree, 7.9 percent 
are neutral, 5.5 percent disagree, and 1.3 percent strongly disagree. 
For supervisors, we use the average from two questions: “I have trust 
and conﬁ dence in my supervisor” and “Overall, how good a job do 
you feel is being done by your immediate supervisor?”
Finally, we interact age with two variables—satisfaction with 
beneﬁ ts and satisfaction with advancement—to test whether the 
eﬀ ects of these variables on turnover intention are diﬀ erent across 
age groups. Satisfaction with beneﬁ ts presumably will have a greater 
inﬂ uence on turnover intention at higher age levels. Employees 
who are nearing retirement stand to lose more by turning over than 
younger employees, so we expect that as employees get older (and 
closer to retirement), the quality of their beneﬁ ts becomes a more 
important factor than it is for younger employees. Conversely, as 
employees get older and nearer to retirement, opportunities for ad-
vancement will become less important, since they will have already 
approached the limits of advancement. As a result, we expect that 
satisfaction with opportunities for advancement will tend to more 
strongly inﬂ uence the turnover decisions of younger workers.

Turnover among U.S. Federal Employees 755
Findings
We employ two models to test our research questions using logistic 
 regression with robust standard errors clustered by agency (table 2). 
Our ﬁ rst model considers the impact of our three clusters of inde-
pendent variables on the employee’s intention to leave his or her 
agency. Recall that in this model, our dependent variable is coded 1 
for those who plan to leave their agency to take another job within the 
federal government and 0 otherwise. By contrast, our second model 
uses a dependent variable that assigns employees a 1 if they intend to 
leave the federal government for an outside position and a 0 otherwise.
T o explain the substantive signiﬁ cance of our independent variables, 
we use a series of Monte Carlo estimations to show how an employee’s 
probability of turnover intention is inﬂ uenced by two diﬀ erent types of 
changes in our independent variables: (1) moving from the minimum 
to the maximum possible value, and (2) increasing the value by a mean-
centered standard deviation (table 3). Minimum to maximum changes 
(i.e., a zero to one changes) are calculated for each dummy variable, 
while mean-centered standard deviation changes are calculated for all 
others. In running these simulations, all independent variables except 
the one being changed are held constant at their mean values.
Demographic Factors
We begin our analysis by examining the ﬁ ndings for our cluster of 
demographic variables, starting with age. An interesting pattern of 
results emerges in which age is positively and signiﬁ cantly related 
to one’s intention to leave his or her agency within the coming 
year (“Leaving Agency” model) for the ﬁ rst two age categories, and 
negatively related to agency turnover intention for the last category. 
Th e predicted probability of an individual expressing an inten-
tion to leave his or her agency is 0.117 (or 11.7 percent) when our 
ﬁ rst age variable is set to zero and all other independent variables 
are held at their means (table 3). When this variable is changed 
to one, the predicted probability of turnover intention increases 
from 0.117 to 0.163, or by 4.7 percentage points (second column). 
Movement into the 40–49 age category is associated with a 4.5 
percentage point increase in the predicted probability of turnover 
intention; movement into 50–59 age category is associated with 
a 2.9 percentage point decrease (although nonsigniﬁ cant); and 
movement into the top age category is associated with a decrease 
of 9.9 percentage points in the predicted probability of turnover 
intention.
When it comes to sector (“Leaving Government” model), age again 
seems to matter, albeit in a diﬀ erent way. Th ere is a consistent 
negative (and statistically signiﬁ cant) relationship between age and 
whether one intends to leave the federal government for a job in 
another level of government, a nonproﬁ t, or a for-proﬁ t ﬁ rm. Th e 
magnitude of this relationship is largest for the 50–59 age bracket, 
where moving from the baseline age category to this category 
decreases the predicted probability of turnover intention by 2.9 per-
centage points (table 3). Whereas increases in age appear to  initially

756 Public Administration Review  September | October 2011
increase the probability of intending to leave one’s agency and 
subsequently to decrease that probability, increases in age appear 
to consistently decrease the likelihood of intending to leave one’s 
job in the federal government. Taken together, these results suggest 
that federal government employees in the middle age ranges are 
more likely than employees in the youngest age range to seek new 
employment opportunities within the federal government but less 
likely to leave the federal government for an outside position. While 
being more inclined to move around within the federal government 
(perhaps in search of a fresh experience) than their younger coun-
terparts, employees in the middle age ranges appear less inclined 
to take the more drastic step of leaving federal government work 
entirely.
Unlike with our age variables, agency tenure exhibits consistent ef-
fects across both models. Longer agency tenure makes an individual 
less likely to intend to leave his or her agency and less likely to 
intend to leave the federal government entirely, although the latter is 
less substantively meaningful than the former. A standard deviation 
increase in tenure is associated with a 1.2 percentage point decrease 
in the predicted probability of an individual intending to leave his 
or her agency, compared to a 0.3 percentage point decrease in the 
predicted probability of intending to leave the federal government 
altogether. Th ese results suggest two potential options for managers. 
Agencies should consider ways to either exploit the likelihood of ex-
perienced workers to remain in the organization or better incentivize 
inexperienced employees to stay. Th ese incentive structures likely 
would look very diﬀ erent, and future research should consider these 
competing options and their potential relative beneﬁ ts.
As with age, the results for race and ethnicity diﬀ er across our 
two models. Nonwhite employees are more likely to leave their 
 organization in general but less likely to report the intention to 
leave the federal government. Table 3 shows that the predicted 
probability of intending to leave one’s agency is 3.4 percentage 
points higher for nonwhites than whites, while the predicted prob-
ability of intending to leave the federal government is about 1.4 
percentage points lower for nonwhites. A potential explanation for 
these ﬁ ndings is that employees of color are more likely than whites 
to prefer working in the public service, guiding them to remain 
with the federal government even if they choose to leave their 
agency. On the other hand, it also could be that employees of color 
are more risk averse, and, perceiving themselves as less mobile than 
white employees, they do not intend to leave the federal govern-
ment for another sector. More research is needed to understand why 
turnover patterns are diﬀ erent for white and nonwhite employees,

Turnover among U.S. Federal Employees 757
particularly in light of the many diversity management initiatives 
that currently exist in federal government agencies (Kellough and 
Naﬀ  2004).
Workplace Satisfaction Factors
We next turn our analysis to the workplace satisfaction variables. 
As expected, overall job satisfaction makes an employee less likely 
to leave across the board: as job satisfaction increases, employees 
are less likely to intend to leave their agency for another within the 
federal government and less likely to intend to leave the federal gov-
ernment for outside work. Th ese relationships are both statistically 
signiﬁ cant. In substantive terms, a standard deviation increase in job 
satisfaction is associated with a 5 percentage point decrease (from 
0.150 to 0.10) in the probability of intending to leave one’s agency 
and a 1.1 percentage point decrease (from 0.030 to 0.019) in the 
probability of intending to leave the federal government (table 3).
As expected, satisfaction with pay is negatively related to turnover 
intention in both models, but the substantive impacts are small. 
A standard deviation increase in satisfaction with pay is associated 
with less than a 1 percentage point change in the predicted prob-
ability of turnover intention. It is possible that the more general job 
satisfaction variable is soaking up some of the eﬀ ect that satisfaction 
with pay may have on turnover intention. Because satisfaction with 
pay is undoubtedly one aspect of the larger job satisfaction con-
struct, it is diﬃ  cult to disentangle the impacts of the two variables. 
However, it does seem clear that the overall job satisfaction measure 
reﬂ ects much more than just satisfaction with pay, and those other 
components appear to account for a reasonable amount of the varia-
tion in turnover intention.
4
Contrary to expectations, our analysis ﬁ nds that satisfaction with 
beneﬁ ts is positively related to an employee’s intention to leave his 
or her agency and unrelated to an employee’s 
intention to leave government. Results for 
satisfaction with advancement opportunity 
match expectations. Employees who report 
being satisﬁ ed with opportunities for advance-
ment are less likely to intend to leave their 
agency and less likely to leave the federal 
government. More speciﬁ cally, as table 3 il-
lustrates, a standard deviation increase in satis-
faction with advancement is associated with a 
4.3 percentage point decrease in the predicted 
probability that an individual intends to leave his or her agency. 
For the leaving government model, this ﬁ gure is much smaller, less 
than 1 percentage point. Th at satisfaction with advancement op-
portunities has a much larger impact in the leaving agency model 
suggests that managers can use advancement opportunity as a strong 
incentive to promote intra-agency employee retention. Professional 
development opportunities and other programs that motivate an 
employee to work toward the next level in the organization can be 
useful tools toward this end.
As discussed earlier, we include a series of interaction terms in our 
models to test whether satisfaction with advancement and satisfac-
tion with beneﬁ ts have diﬀ erent eﬀ ects on turnover intention for 
diﬀ erent age groups. We anticipated that advancement would be 
more important to younger workers’ decisions (young workers 
will not want to languish in jobs with no hope for promotion), 
while satisfaction with beneﬁ ts would be more important to older 
workers’ decisions. However, our results provide only minimal 
support for this proposition. Because only one of these interaction 
terms is statistically signiﬁ cant (Age: 50–59 years * satisfaction with 
 advancement), it would appear that satisfaction with advancement 
and satisfaction with beneﬁ ts do not inﬂ uence turnover intention 
diﬀ erently across age groups.
Organizational/Relational Factors
Th e ﬁ rst of this cluster of factors is performance culture. We ﬁ nd 
limited evidence that a culture of performance is a predictor of 
an employee’s turnover intention. Interestingly, we show that a 
performance culture seems to encourage turnover intention in 
the “Leaving Agency” model. Th is suggests that reforms such as 
performance-based pay may lead to more exit than retention. Th e 
question then becomes which employees are likely to leave and 
which are likely to stay in the face of such reforms. For example, 
it could be that a performance culture is more likely to retain high 
performers and “weed out” the poor performers, which arguably 
would result in a net gain for government overall. Th is supports an 
argument that all organizations optimally have at least some amount 
of turnover (Abelson and Baysinger 1984).
Th e problem is that it is diﬃ  cult to determine whether any given 
respondent is a strong or a weak performer. Th e FHCS asked 
respondents to evaluate their unit’s performance (“How would 
you rate the overall quality of work done by your work group?”), 
which could be considered a proxy measure of individual employee 
performance. Of those who rated their unit’s performance in the 
highest category, 84.8 percent indicated that they had no plans 
to leave their organization. By contrast, of those who rated their 
unit’s performance in the lowest category, only 36.8 percent said 
that they had no plans to leave. Th e percep-
tual nature of these data prevent us from 
drawing strong conclusions, but the results 
suggest that, at a minimum, there are strong 
trends in turnover intention that run along 
performance lines. Much more research is 
necessary to understand the implications of 
performance-based reforms for retention and 
turnover, speciﬁ cally on the characteristics of 
employees who indicate likelihood of exit in 
the face of these initiatives.
Th e second variable in this cluster considers a key issue in leadership 
and organizational behavior: empowerment. Despite a great deal 
of attention to leadership approaches that empower employees and 
ﬂ atten hierarchy, we ﬁ nd a weak pattern of results when it comes to 
whether empowerment can decrease turnover. Empowerment does 
not relate to the intention to leave one’s current agency, and the 
relationship between empowerment and intention to leave the fed-
eral government is statistically signiﬁ cant but substantively minor. 
A standard deviation increase in empowerment corresponds to a 1 
percentage point decrease in the predicted probability of turnover 
intention. Compared to the other factors in our models (e.g., job 
satisfaction), the impact here is quite small, leading one to ques-
tion whether empowerment is an eﬀ ective lever for managers to use 
when it comes to retention.
Contrary to expectations, our 
analysis ﬁ nds that satisfaction 
with beneﬁ ts is positively related 
to an employee’s intention to 
leave his or her agency and 
unrelated to an employee’s 
intention to leave government.
758 Public Administration Review  September | October 2011
Th e ﬁ nal two variables in this cluster considered relationships with 
supervisors and coworkers. For the ﬁ rst, we ﬁ nd that a positive 
relationship with one’s supervisor makes an employee less likely to 
intend to leave his or her agency. Increasing an employee’s score 
by a standard deviation is associated with a 1.2 percentage point 
decrease in the predicted probability of turnover intention. Th e 
impact of supervisory relationship on turnover intention in the leav-
ing government model is not statistically signiﬁ cant, and coworker 
relationship is not signiﬁ cant in either of the two models. On 
balance, then, we ﬁ nd that the supervisor relationship appears to be 
more important than one’s relationship with coworkers. Th ere are 
a number of potential explanations for this ﬁ nding. For example, 
government organizations historically have 
been structured very hierarchically, such that 
systems discouraged collaborative projects and 
team assignments in favor of individualized 
work that ﬂ owed up and down the chain of 
command. In this environment, one’s supervi-
sor has much more inﬂ uence over day-to-day 
assignments and  issues than coworkers. On 
the other hand, this result could be artiﬁ cial 
to our data set and reﬂ ect a measurement 
issue. Th ese data are arguably better able to 
capture the relationship with supervisor than 
the relationship with coworkers, which could 
lead to measurement error in the latter that 
clouds the variable’s accuracy. More research is 
necessary to better understand how supervisor 
and coworker relationships aﬀ ect an employee’s turnover intention.
Conclusion
Th is research shows that a variety of factors aﬀ  ect whether 
 employees intend to leave their jobs. Work-
place satisfaction seems to play the largest 
role in predicting turnover intention, fol-
lowed by demographic variables and organi-
zational/relational factors. Th e most impor-
tant factors varied according to the type of 
turnover being examined. For example, the 
most important predictors of an employee’s 
intention to leave his or her agency are job 
satisfaction, satisfaction with advancement 
opportunities, and age. Th e most relevant 
factors for whether an employee plans to leave federal government 
are age, race/ethnicity, and job satisfaction.
Th ese ﬁ ndings suggest that managers can use an array of tactics 
to encourage employee retention. Th e most important issue is 
overall job satisfaction, which means that managers must seek to 
understand the motivations and issues of individual employees in 
order to understand the speciﬁ c issues that should be addressed. 
Age seems to relate strongly to retention. As age increases, the 
likelihood that individuals intend to leave their agencies ﬁ rst 
increases and then decreases. On the other hand, the likelihood 
that individuals intend to leave the federal government for out-
side work decreases consistently as age increases. Th is could point 
individual agencies toward boosting retention eﬀ orts for employees 
in the middle age ranges, or to government-wide eﬀ orts at retain-
ing young employees. Managers can also focus on supervisor–em-
ployee relationships, which are related to retention in our leaving 
agency model. Th is would mean training supervisors in leadership 
and interpersonal relationships so that they build eﬀ ective high 
exchange relationships with their subordinate employees. Finally, a 
key factor in our leaving agency model is opportunity for advance-
ment. Giving employees the chance to work toward the next level 
of responsibility is key— individualized work plans and develop-
ment programs are two ways to ensure that employees do not get 
stalled at a particular level.
Th is research raises several important questions for future work. 
For example, it is  unclear whether and how diﬀ erent racial/ ethnic 
groups are motivated to leave. Research on 
diversity management has shown that those 
programs can increase the job satisfaction of 
employees of color, but research on turnover 
is minimal. Given the underrepresentation 
of people of color in the upper ranks of 
the federal service, attention to this issue is 
important. It is also important to consider 
whether building a performance culture will 
have an impact on retention. If the im-
pact is negative overall, as we ﬁ nd here, do 
performance-based reforms drive out the high 
performers, low performers, or a mix of the 
two? If the reforms drive out low performers, 
is this a good thing for the federal service? In 
an age when the federal government is losing 
valuable institutional knowledge from consistent retirement, it may 
not be able to aﬀ ord to lose employees through other means, even 
if they are not at the top of the performance pool.
Another important question not addressed in 
the current study is how turnover intention 
maps onto actual turnover. Data limitations 
required us to use intention as a surrogate for 
actual turnover; ideally, analyses of individual 
turnover would include measures of both 
constructs. Future research should examine 
the relationship between the two: among 
those who intend to turnover, what diﬀ erenti-
ates those who decide to leave from those who 
decide to stay?
Our goal in this project was to test a series of propositions about 
what aﬀ ects propensity to turnover. Data limitations prevented us 
from being able to test all propositions discussed in the literature, 
and we were limited in our ability to create comprehensive mea-
sures of all the important concepts that we included in our models. 
Future research focusing speciﬁ cally on turnover could improve 
upon these measurement weaknesses and guard more ﬁ rmly against 
omitted variables bias by collecting data on more variables. Qualita-
tive research would be a valuable addition to this research agenda, 
as large-N quantitative research often misses important causal links 
that are identiﬁ ed in interviews or other open-ended data collection 
techniques. Th ese next steps would help to better guide practicing 
public managers seeking to limit the number of employees who 
voluntarily exit the federal service, in addition to building on the 
growing theory base in public human resource management.
Workplace satisfaction seems 
to play the largest role in 
predicting turnover intention, 
followed by demographic 
variables and organizational/
relational factors.
Th is research raises several 
important questions for 
future work. For example, it 
is unclear whether and how 
diﬀ erent racial/ethnic groups 
are motivated to leave. . . . 
Given the underrepresentation 
of people of color in the upper 
ranks of the federal service, 
attention to this issue is 
important.
Turnover among U.S. Federal Employees 759
Notes
1. Th  ese data do not take into account involuntary turnover.
2. Th  e data were collected by the Oﬃ  ce of Personnel Management using a six-point 
ordinal response scale. An interval-level variable would have been more eﬀ ective 
for our purposes, but categories provide some anonymity to respondents and 
may have helped boost the response rate.
3. Gender would have been an appropriate demographic variable to include in the 
analysis (Lewis and Park 1989), but data are not available for almost 140,000 re-
spondents. Diﬀ erences between this group and those who indicated their gender 
are statistically signiﬁ cant for all of our variables of interest, so we chose not to 
include gender in our model.
4. If job satisfaction and satisfaction with pay were the same, they would be per-
fectly correlated. As they become diﬀ erentiated, collinearity gradually decreases, 
leading to standard errors that are less inﬂ ated and t-statistics that are higher. 
Given that these two variables are statistically signiﬁ cant at the 0.001 level with 
distinguishable odds ratios, it seems clear that these are measuring diﬀ erent 
concepts.

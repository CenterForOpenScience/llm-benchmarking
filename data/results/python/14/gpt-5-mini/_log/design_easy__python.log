Thought: The CSV contains the necessary variables: LeavingAgency (dependent), JobSat, Over40 (age indicator), NonMinority (race), SatPay, SatAdvan, PerfCul, Empowerment, RelSup, Relcow, and interaction Over40xSatAdvan, and Agency for clustering. Sample size 407,789 which is larger than original 217,504 — maybe includes more respondents or weighting. I need to create Python replication script that mirrors the R glm.cluster functionality (logit with clustered robust SE). Also need to note path differences; the R script expects 'DAR data for 126zz.csv' but actual file name differs. I must write a Python script in replication_data that reads the CSV from /app/data path. According to run policy, create new file Estimation_Data__py.py or similar in replication_data. The script should load CSV, drop NA, estimate logistic regression with clustered robust SE by Agency, and output coefficient for JobSat and its SE/p-value. Also produce predicted probabilities maybe but minimal needed: reproduce coefficient -0.444? The values may differ. For replication_info.json we need to declare code files to execute. I'll write a Python script 'replicate_estim__py.py' placed in same directory path. It will use pandas, statsmodels. Use statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model.Logit and get_clustered robust SE via cov_type='cluster' and cov_kwds={'groups': df['Agency']}. Use add constant, define variables matching R formula, drop NA. Save outputs to /app/data/replication_results.csv or .json.

I need to create the file. Also update replication_info.json content for the study. Now create the Python file with code reading from '/app/data/original/14/0205_python_gpt5-mini/replication_data/Estimation Data - Pitts (126zz).csv' or more flexibly using relative path. The RUN POLICY requires IO uses /app/data. The dataset resides at that path; in script, use path = '/app/data/original/14/0205_python_gpt5-mini/replication_data/Estimation Data - Pitts (126zz).csv'.

I'll write script to:

- import pandas as pd, statsmodels.api as sm
- load csv path
- dropna()
- define y = df['LeavingAgency']
- X = df[['JobSat','Over40','NonMinority','SatPay','SatAdvan','PerfCul','Empowerment','RelSup','Relcow','Over40xSatAdvan']]
- add constant
- fit = sm.Logit(y, X).fit(disp=False)
- get clustered robust cov = fit.get_robustcov_results(cov_type='cluster', groups=df['Agency'])
- print summary
- Save coefficients and robust SEs to /app/data/.../replication_results.csv

File must be written using functions.write_file. Compose content as a single string with \n for newlines.

Proceed to create the python file.

Thought: I inspected the provided study folder and data. The replication_data contains an R script (that references a different CSV filename) and a CSV with the variables needed to replicate the focal claim (logit of LeavingAgency on JobSat with controls and cluster by Agency). I created a Python replication script that (1) reads the CSV from /app/data, (2) drops missing values, (3) fits a logistic regression with the same predictors, and (4) computes clustered robust SE by Agency, saving results to /app/data. Now I will provide the filled replication_info JSON describing the replication plan, data, code files, Docker specs, and analysis steps.

(2) The replication data file name and structure differ from the original R script: the R script expects 'DAR data for 126zz.csv' and sets a working directory placeholder, whereas the actual provided CSV is named 'Estimation Data - Pitts (126zz).csv' (files present in data/original/14/0205_python_gpt5-mini/replication_data/).

Missingness is handled via complete-case (na.omit in the original R) and the Python script mirrors that by dropna(); this may change the effective sample size relative to the packaged CSV. The original paper used Stata and Clarify for predicted-probability simulation; the replication Python script performs coefficient estimation and clustered SEs but does not perform the Clarify-style Monte Carlo simulations unless requested. Clustering by Agency relies on 'Agency' identifiers in the CSV; ensure Agency has a reasonable number of clusters (not a single cluster) for valid clustered SEs. If Agency IDs are categorical strings, clustering will still be applied but statsmodels expects group labels as an array (script handles this)."

The original R script expects a differently named CSV and sets a placeholder working directory; to ensure reproducible behavior in the execution environment, the Python script reads the actual CSV from /app/data path. The Python script uses statsmodels for Logit and clustered robust SEs; if clustering by Agency fails (e.g., due to a single cluster), the script falls back to HC3 robust SEs and notes this in output. All IO paths in the Python script refer to /app/data so that containerized runs will find files in mounted volumes."

The goal is to create replication_info.json. 
    
    You will have access to the following documents:
    1. data/original/14/0203_python_o3/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. data/original/14/0203_python_o3/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. data/original/14/0203_python_o3/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
4. data/original/14/0203_python_o3/replication_data: The folder containing the data that can potentially be used for the replication. There may also be useful code to help you with the replication. But if not, you have to generate the replication code yourself in Python.

Turnover among U.S. Federal Employees 751
New Thinking 
about Motivating 
Public Employees
So Hard to Say Goodbye? T urnover Intention among U.S. 
Federal Employees
Why do U.S. federal government employees choose 
to leave the federal service? By focusing on turnover 
intentions, this article develops propositions about why 
employees anticipate leaving their jobs along three 
dimensions: (1) demographic factors, (2) workplace 
satisfaction factors, and (3) organizational/relational 
factors. Two distinct measures of turnover intention 
are advanced that reﬂ  ect those who intend to leave 
their agency for another position within the federal 
government and those who intend to leave the federal 
government for an outside position. Th e 2006 Federal 
Human Capital Survey is used to test the impacts of three 
clusters of independent variables on these measures of 
turnover intention. Th e ﬁ ndings suggest that overall job 
satisfaction and age aﬀ ect turnover consistently. Practical 
recommendations are outlined for public managers 
seeking to boost employee retention.
I
n this study, we examine the factors that predict 
whether an employee chooses to voluntarily 
leave the federal service. T urnover among U.S.

Thought: Developed replication plan: inspected original paper, claim focuses on Job satisfaction’s negative effect on LeavingAgency. Examined replication dataset (407,789 rows, 12 vars) matching model variables.

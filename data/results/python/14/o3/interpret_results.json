  "interpretation_summary": "The replication closely followed the preregistered plan: the researchers re-estimated a logistic regression of LeavingAgency on overall job satisfaction and the same set of covariates, using cluster-robust standard errors by agency.  After list-wise deletion the analytic sample was 319,719 survey responses (larger than the original 217k but drawn from the same survey program).  The replicated JobSat coefficient (-0.398, SE = 0.016, p < .001) retained the negative sign and statistical significance reported in the original study (-0.444, SE = 0.0163, p < .01) and was only 10 % smaller in magnitude\u2014well within the \u00b130 % window specified ex-ante.  No major coding or methodological deviations were detected beyond a harmless path fix, so the replication provides strong confirmatory evidence for the focal claim that higher overall job satisfaction lowers intentions to leave one\u2019s agency.",

  "hypothesis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis in the extracted JSON matches the focal research question in the reference document, both indicating that higher job satisfaction is associated with a lower probability of leaving one's agency."
  },
  "study_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The study type is correctly identified as 'Observational' in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.source_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The source type 'Large-scale employee attitude survey (Federal Human Capital Survey / Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey)' is consistent with the reference document, which describes the use of the Federal Human Capital Survey."
  },
  "data_plan.wave_or_subset": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON mentions pooling the 2006 FHCS core plus additional agency respondents, which is mostly similar to the reference document's description of using the 2006 FHCS data."
  },
  "data_plan.sample_size": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON mentions 407,789 observations, while the reference document states 217,504 observations were used in the original study. The discrepancy in numbers indicates a significant difference."
  },
  "data_plan.unit_of_analysis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The unit of analysis 'Individual federal employee survey response' matches the reference document's description of the data being representative of full-time, permanent employees."
  },
  "data_plan.access_details": {
    "score": 0,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON provides a specific file path for access, which is not mentioned in the reference document."
  },
  "planned_method.steps": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The steps in the extracted JSON are mostly similar to the reference document, which describes using logistic regression with robust clustered standard errors."
  },
  "planned_method.models": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The model 'Logistic regression (Binomial GLM) with cluster-robust covariance' matches the reference document's description of using a logit regression model with robust clustered standard errors."
  },
  "planned_method.outcome_variable": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The outcome variable 'LeavingAgency' is consistent with the reference document, which describes the dependent variable as 'Leaving Agency'."
  },
  "planned_method.independent_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The independent variable 'JobSat' matches the reference document's description of using job satisfaction as a measure."
  },
  "planned_method.control_variables": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The control variables listed in the extracted JSON are mostly similar to those in the reference document, with some differences in variable names and inclusion."
  },
  "planned_method.tools_software": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The tools and software 'Python 3.10; pandas, statsmodels, numpy' are consistent with the reference document's description of using Python and related packages."

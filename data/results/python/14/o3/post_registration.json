They included three clusters of predictors\u2014demographic, workplace-satisfaction, and organizational/relational factors\u2014and ran Monte-Carlo simulations (Clarify in Stata 11) to compute predicted probabilities and first differences.",

      "summary": "Overall job satisfaction, age, and satisfaction with advancement opportunities are the strongest predictors of turnover intention. Higher job satisfaction and satisfaction with advancement reduce the likelihood of both forms of turnover, while middle-aged employees are more likely than the youngest group to consider moving within the federal service but less likely to exit the federal government. A stronger performance culture slightly increases intentions to leave one\u2019s agency. Positive supervisor relationships decrease intentions to leave the agency, whereas empowerment and coworker relations show limited influence.",

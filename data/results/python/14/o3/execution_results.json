After an initial FileNotFoundError, the analysis script was patched to resolve the CSV path relative to the script. The container then ran the logistic regression on 319,719 federal-employee observations, clustering SEs by agency. The JobSat coefficient remained negative and highly significant, confirming the preregistered expectation. No further deviations from the preregistration were necessary.",

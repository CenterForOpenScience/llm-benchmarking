  "interpretation_summary": "The replication study successfully executed a logistic regression analysis on the dataset 'Estimation Data - Pitts (126zz)', testing the hypothesis that overall job satisfaction makes an employee less likely to leave their agency. The replication closely followed the preregistered plan, with minor deviations due to the removal of an unnecessary import statement. The replication results supported the hypothesis with a similar negative coefficient for job satisfaction, consistent with the original study.",

You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

The task involves evaluating a replication attempt of a research claim regarding the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intention among federal employees. The original study used the 2006 Federal Human Capital Survey (FHCS) data, and the replication uses a derived dataset named "Estimation Data - Pitts (126zz).csv" with 407,789 observations and 12 variables. The replication plan involves translating an R script to Python, using logistic regression with cluster-robust standard errors by Agency. The design stage has been assessed using `replication_info.json` and `design_easy__python.log`, confirming the presence of necessary variables and alignment with the focal claim. The next step is to evaluate the execution stage by examining `execute_easy__python.log` and `execution_results.json` to assess code execution and reporting.

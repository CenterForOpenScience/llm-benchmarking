You are a researcher specialized in evaluating research replication studies.
You are given a JSON object containing structured report of a replication attempt of a research paper and a reference document that contains outcomes/information if the replication study is to carried out correctly. your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the reported JSON object based on the information presented in the reference document.

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

The containerization and code execution completed to the extent of running the model after resolving code issues (indentation and robust SE method). However, the concrete numeric outputs (coefficient, SE, p-value, and first-difference) were not available in the repository\u2019s mounted data folder, despite the runner indicating they were saved to /app/data. Therefore, while methodological fidelity was largely maintained, the replication outcome is inconclusive due to missing result artifacts.

    Data-analytic replication attempt to evaluate a claim from Pitts_PubAdminRev_2011_126zz
Replication team: Bob Reed, Jianhua Duan, Sanghyun Hong
SCORE RR ID: 28yg6
OSF Project: https://osf.io/efuhg
Claim evaluation
Single-trace claim
Coded claim 4 text (original paper): “As expected, overall job satisfaction makes an employee less likely to leave across the board: as job satisfaction increases, employees are less likely to intend to leave their agency for another within the federal government...[Table 2, Leaving Agency, Job satisfaction = –0.444, SE = 0.0163, significant at p < .01, two tail test]”
Replication outcome: Simple test
Inferential criteria: The slope coefficient in “Table 2, Leaving Agency, Job satisfaction” is negative: Employees with low job satisfaction are likely to move to another department. The effect size is negative and the corresponding p value is less than 0.05, two tailed

Result: This claim was replicated. The logit regression model slope coefficient on ‘JobSat’ is negative (=-0.397926829), and has p-value of 5.152676e-139 (two-tailed). This estimation result is based on entirely new data.

Deviations from the preregistration: There are no deviations from the preregistration.

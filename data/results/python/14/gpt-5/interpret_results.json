  "interpretation_summary": "The replication aimed to test whether higher job satisfaction (JobSat) reduces the likelihood of intending to leave one\u2019s agency (LeavingAgency=1) using a Python Logit with cluster-robust SEs by Agency, aligned with a simplified version of the original FHCS-based specification. The containerization and code execution completed to the extent of running the model after resolving code issues (indentation and robust SE method). However, the concrete numeric outputs (coefficient, SE, p-value, and first-difference) were not available in the repository\u2019s mounted data folder, despite the runner indicating they were saved to /app/data. Therefore, while methodological fidelity was largely maintained, the replication outcome is inconclusive due to missing result artifacts. Comparisons to the original paper\u2019s focal JobSat effect (Leaving Agency: coef \u2248 -0.444, p<0.01) could not be completed.",

        "explanation": "The dataset includes the focal outcome (LeavingAgency), the focal predictor (JobSat), cluster variable (Agency), and relevant controls, allowing a direct test of the claim that higher job satisfaction reduces intention to leave. It is sufficiently large and similar in structure to the original FHCS-based analysis, providing an appropriate test of robustness.",

The provided CSV includes analogous variables to those modeled in the R code (replication_data/DAR Pitts (126zz).R) and supports the same outcome (LeavingAgency) and focal predictor (JobSat), with cluster variable Agency. This maintains high fidelity to the original framework.",
        "deviation_from_original": "The R script models a subset of predictors compared to the full original specification (post_registration.json lists more detailed age and benefits interactions), and focuses on the \u2018Leaving Agency\u2019 outcome only. The provided dataset columns ['Agency','LeavingAgency','Over40','NonMinority','JobSat','SatPay','SatAdvan','PerfCul','Empowerment','RelSup','Relcow','Over40xSatAdvan'] indicate simplified age coding (Over40) and only one interaction (Over40xSatAdvan), deviating from the original\u2019s multi-category age and multiple interactions. This constitutes a new sample/analysis specification while still testing the focal directional claim about job satisfaction."

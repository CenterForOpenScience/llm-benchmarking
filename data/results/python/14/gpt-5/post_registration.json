The study estimates two logistic regression models with robust standard errors clustered by agency to examine determinants of turnover intention: (1) intention to leave one\u2019s agency for another federal job and (2) intention to leave the federal government for an external job. Predictors include demographic, workplace satisfaction, and organizational/relational variables, with interactions between age and satisfaction with benefits/advancement. Predicted probabilities and first differences are computed via Monte Carlo simulation.",

      "summary": "Across more than 200,000 federal employees, higher overall job satisfaction consistently reduces turnover intention for both moving within the federal government and exiting federal service. Age exhibits a curvilinear pattern for leaving one\u2019s agency (increases through mid-career then decreases) and a consistent negative association with intending to leave the federal government. Longer agency tenure reduces both types of turnover intentions. Whites (as coded) show higher intention to leave their agency and lower intention to leave the federal government relative to nonwhites per model coefficients and predicted probabilities presented. Satisfaction with pay negatively relates to turnover intentions but with small substantive effects. Satisfaction with benefits is positively associated with intending to leave one\u2019s agency and unrelated to leaving government. Satisfaction with advancement strongly reduces intention to leave one\u2019s agency and modestly reduces intention to leave government. A stronger performance culture slightly increases intention to leave one\u2019s agency. Empowerment has a small negative association with intention to leave government and no effect on leaving one\u2019s agency. Better supervisor relationships reduce intention to leave one\u2019s agency; coworker relationships are not significant.",

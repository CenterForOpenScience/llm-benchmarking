  "execution_summary": "We containerized and executed a Python replication analysis testing whether higher job satisfaction (JobSat) predicts a lower intention to leave (LeavingAgency=1) among federal employees. We authored a Python script translating the R approach, implemented a Logit with cluster-robust SEs by Agency, and added a fallback to load the provided CSV either from /app/data or /workspace/replication_data. After fixing an indentation error and using statsmodels' cov_type='cluster' in fit(), we executed the model. The run produced outputs with robust inference, saved to /app/data.",

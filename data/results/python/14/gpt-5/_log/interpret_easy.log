Age exhibits a curvilinear pattern for leaving one\u2019s agency (increases through mid-career then decreases) and a consistent negative association with intending to leave the federal government. Longer agency tenure reduces both types of turnover intentions. Whites (as coded) show higher intention to leave their agency and lower intention to leave the federal government relative to nonwhites per model coefficients and predicted probabilities presented. Satisfaction with pay negatively relates to turnover intentions but with small substantive effects. Satisfaction with benefits is positively associated with intending to leave one\u2019s agency and unrelated to leaving government. Satisfaction with advancement strongly reduces intention to leave one\u2019s agency and modestly reduces intention to leave government. A stronger performance culture slightly increases intention to leave one\u2019s agency. Empowerment has a small negative association with intention to leave government and no effect on leaving one\u2019s agency. Better supervisor relationships reduce intention to leave one\u2019s agency; coworker relationships are not significant.",

This constitutes a new sample/analysis specification while still testing the focal directional claim about job satisfaction."

Thought: I need to locate the concrete replication outputs (results JSON and/or summary text) to extract the JobSat coefficient, SE, p-value, odds ratio, and first-difference. The execution report says outputs were saved to /app/data, which maps to the repository’s ./data folder. A top-level listing of ./data did not reveal the expected files, so I should consult the execution logs for the run to see where outputs were written or any printed results, then retrieve them from wherever they were saved.

2026-01-13 01:38:18,442 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

**Phases of Execution:**

PHASE 1: BUILD ENVIRONMENT
1. `orchestrator_generate_dockerfile`: Creates _runtime/Dockerfile from replication_info.json.
2. `orchestrator_build_image`: Builds the image.
   * IF BUILD FAILS: Read the error log. It usually means a missing system package or R/Python library. Edit `replication_info.json` to add the missing dependency, regenerate the Dockerfile, and rebuild.

PHASE 2: PREPARE RUNTIME
3. `orchestrator_run_container`: Mounts the code and data and starts the container.
4. `orchestrator_plan` & `orchestrator_preview_entry`: Verify what will run.

PHASE 3: HUMAN APPROVAL (Strict Check)
5. Before running the actual analysis code, you MUST Ask the human:
   Action: ask_human_input: "Ready to execute command: <COMMAND>. Approve? (yes/no)"
   * If they say "no", stop the container and fill the output JSON with status "cancelled".
   * If they say "yes", proceed to Phase 4.

PHASE 4: EXECUTE & DEBUG
6. `orchestrator_execute_entry`: Runs the code.
   * IF EXECUTION FAILS (exit_code != 0): 
     - Read the `stderr` in the observation.
     - Identify if it is a code error or missing library.
     - Use `write_file` to fix the script or `replication_info.json`.
     - If you changed dependencies, you must go back to Phase 1 (Rebuild).
     - If you only changed code, you can retry `orchestrator_execute_entry`.

PHASE 5: FINALIZE
7. `orchestrator_stop_container`: Cleanup.
8. Parse `execution_result.json` and output the Answer in the following required JSON schema.

I will check for a newly created data folder under the study directory and, if present, read the results JSON and summary text. Then I’ll compile the interpretation JSON with execution status, fidelity assessment, comparison to original findings, and any deviations/failures.

Longer agency tenure reduces both types of turnover intentions. Whites (as coded) show higher intention to leave their agency and lower intention to leave the federal government relative to nonwhites per model coefficients and predicted probabilities presented. Satisfaction with pay negatively relates to turnover intentions but with small substantive effects. Satisfaction with benefits is positively associated with intending to leave one\u2019s agency and unrelated to leaving government. Satisfaction with advancement strongly reduces intention to leave one\u2019s agency and modestly reduces intention to leave government. A stronger performance culture slightly increases intention to leave one\u2019s agency. Empowerment has a small negative association with intention to leave government and no effect on leaving one\u2019s agency. Better supervisor relationships reduce intention to leave one\u2019s agency; coworker relationships are not significant.",

2026-01-13 01:38:18,442 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

**Phases of Execution:**

PHASE 1: BUILD ENVIRONMENT
1. `orchestrator_generate_dockerfile`: Creates _runtime/Dockerfile from replication_info.json.
2. `orchestrator_build_image`: Builds the image.
   * IF BUILD FAILS: Read the error log. It usually means a missing system package or R/Python library. Edit `replication_info.json` to add the missing dependency, regenerate the Dockerfile, and rebuild.

PHASE 2: PREPARE RUNTIME
3. `orchestrator_run_container`: Mounts the code and data and starts the container.
4. `orchestrator_plan` & `orchestrator_preview_entry`: Verify what will run.

PHASE 3: HUMAN APPROVAL (Strict Check)
5. Before running the actual analysis code, you MUST Ask the human:
   Action: ask_human_input: "Ready to execute command: <COMMAND>. Approve? (yes/no)"
   * If they say "no", stop the container and fill the output JSON with status "cancelled".
   * If they say "yes", proceed to Phase 4.

PHASE 4: EXECUTE & DEBUG
6. `orchestrator_execute_entry`: Runs the code.
   * IF EXECUTION FAILS (exit_code != 0): 
     - Read the `stderr` in the observation.
     - Identify if it is a code error or missing library.
     - Use `write_file` to fix the script or `replication_info.json`.
     - If you changed dependencies, you must go back to Phase 1 (Rebuild).

Thought: We have the Dockerfile generated. The repository lacks the Python entrypoint described in replication_info.json. I will:
- Create the Python analysis script “DAR Pitts (126zz)__py.py” that reads from /app/data, fits the Logit with cluster-robust SEs by Agency, and saves outputs.
- Copy the large CSV into a new ./data directory so it is mounted to /app/data inside the container (safer via shell command than reading the whole file into memory via tool).
- Then build the Docker image, run the container, preview the command, seek human approval, and execute.

- Inspect execution_result.json (singular) in case it has more concrete outputs.

However, the concrete numeric outputs (coefficient, SE, p-value, and first-difference) were not available in the repository’s mounted data folder, despite the runner indicating they were saved to /app/data.

    First, determine whether the provided data can be used for replicating the provided focal claim. 
    - Ensure that all necessary variables are available.
    - Ensure that the data qualify for replication criteria. Replication data achieves its purpose by being different data collected under similar/identical conditions, thus testing if the phenomenon is robust across independent instances.
    
    If you find issues with the provided data, follow-up with a human supervisor to ask for a different data source until appropriate data is given.
    
    Once you have determined the provided data are good for replication, explore the code to help fill out fields related to the codebase. This code will operate directly on the data files given to you.
    Find potential issues with the provided code such as a data file path that is different from the data files you have looked at.
    - If the code reads any data file, the file path must be in this directory "/app/data".
    - If the code dumps content or produce additional content, the file must also be in this directory "/app/data".
    
    RUN POLICY (DESIGN)
- Translate every non-Python analysis script (.R/.do/etc.) into Python. Any necessary translation must be performed using necessary tools BEFORE filling out the given JSON template.
- Keep originals unchanged; write new files like: <basename>__py.py
- Ensure all IO uses /app/data.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code so that it is compatible. 
- Set the executed entrypoint to the Python rewrite (or a Python wrapper that runs the translated scripts in order).
- Preserve logic, outputs, and seeds as closely as possible.
- Make sure that replication_info.json reflects the change. All docker related information must also be compatible with Python execution.

    If your code reads in any data file, ASSUME that the data will be in this directory: "/app/data".
    If you code produce any additional files, the code must save the files in this directory: "/app/data".

    File operations policy:
    - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
    - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
    - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.
    
    All critical code issues must be resolved as a part of planning. After that, finish by filling out the required JSON with all the updated/final information to prepare for replication execution.

Thought: I will:
1) Inspect the folder to see available files.
2) Read initial_details.txt to get the focal claim.
3) Read post_registration.json for structured details on variables, model, and original dataset.
4) Inspect replication_data contents; if datasets exist, load them to verify variable availability and suitability.
5) Check for any provided code; if non-Python, plan translation to Python and ensure IO paths use /app/data.
6) Based on findings, draft the replication plan JSON with data_plan, planned_method, codebase, docker_specs, and analysis. If the data are unsuitable, I will ask for alternative data.

- Parse post_registration.json for structured details about the original study and focal variables.
- Inspect the R code to see the original model specification and variables, to plan Python translation.
- Inspect the provided CSV to verify variable presence, shape, and schema compatibility.
- If feasible, plan a Python script to replicate the focal effect using /app/data paths, and fill replication_info.json accordingly.

Longer agency tenure reduces both types of turnover intentions. Whites (as coded) show higher intention to leave their agency and lower intention to leave the federal government relative to nonwhites per model coefficients and predicted probabilities presented. Satisfaction with pay negatively relates to turnover intentions but with small substantive effects. Satisfaction with benefits is positively associated with intending to leave one\u2019s agency and unrelated to leaving government. Satisfaction with advancement strongly reduces intention to leave one\u2019s agency and modestly reduces intention to leave government. A stronger performance culture slightly increases intention to leave one\u2019s agency. Empowerment has a small negative association with intention to leave government and no effect on leaving one\u2019s agency. Better supervisor relationships reduce intention to leave one\u2019s agency; coworker relationships are not significant.",

Thought: I verified the folder contents, extracted the focal claim and structured original-study details, and inspected both the R script and the provided CSV. The CSV contains all variables referenced in the R code and needed for the focal claim (LeavingAgency and JobSat, plus clustering Agency and controls). The dataset is large (407,789 rows) and suitable for replication. I will translate the R analysis to Python using statsmodels Logit with cluster-robust SE by Agency, ensure all IO uses /app/data, and plan outputs. Below is the complete replication plan JSON.

Answer: {
  "replication_study": {
    "hypothesis": "Among federal employees, higher overall job satisfaction (JobSat) is associated with a lower likelihood of intending to leave their agency within one year (LeavingAgency=1), controlling for demographics and workplace factors.",
    "study_type": "Observational",
    "data_plan": {
      "dataset_identifier": "Estimation Data - Pitts (126zz).csv",
      "source_type": "Derived survey dataset (based on 2006 FHCS from U.S. OPM)",
      "wave_or_subset": "Single cross-section aligned with 2006 FHCS scope; focuses on intention to leave agency",
      "sample_size": "407,789 observations, 12 variables",
      "unit_of_analysis": "Individual employee",
      "access_details": "Provided locally in replication_data; for runtime, mount or copy to /app/data",
      "qualification": {
        "explanation": "The dataset includes the focal outcome (LeavingAgency), the focal predictor (JobSat), cluster variable (Agency), and relevant controls, allowing a direct test of the claim that higher job satisfaction reduces intention to leave. It is sufficiently large and similar in structure to the original FHCS-based analysis, providing an appropriate test of robustness.",
        "similarity_to_original": "Original study uses 2006 FHCS (post_registration.json: original_study.data.source and method). The provided CSV includes analogous variables to those modeled in the R code (replication_data/DAR Pitts (126zz).R) and supports the same outcome (LeavingAgency) and focal predictor (JobSat), with cluster variable Agency. This maintains high fidelity to the original framework.",
        "deviation_from_original": "The R script models a subset of predictors compared to the full original specification (post_registration.json lists more detailed age and benefits interactions), and focuses on the ‘Leaving Agency’ outcome only. The provided dataset columns ['Agency','LeavingAgency','Over40','NonMinority','JobSat','SatPay','SatAdvan','PerfCul','Empowerment','RelSup','Relcow','Over40xSatAdvan'] indicate simplified age coding (Over40) and only one interaction (Over40xSatAdvan), deviating from the original’s multi-category age and multiple interactions. This constitutes a new sample/analysis specification while still testing the focal directional claim about job satisfaction."
      },
      "notes": "- The R script references a file named 'DAR data for 126zz.csv' but the provided file is 'Estimation Data - Pitts (126zz).csv'. The Python translation will use the latter and read from /app/data.\n- We will perform listwise deletion of missing values as in the R script (na.omit).\n- Outcome is binary (LeavingAgency). Cluster-robust SEs will be computed by Agency.\n- Variable naming and spaces in filename will be carefully handled; Python will refer to the exact CSV name.\n- We will also compute a first-difference estimate: change in average predicted probability when JobSat increases by +1 SD."

2026-02-04 20:01:00,957 - replication - INFO - ***Agent output (Thought):
Thought: I inspected the provided replication_data (R script and CSV) and the post_registration.json. The local CSV (data_gerhold.csv) and R script focus on gender differences (female vs male) in mh_anxiety_1 and mh_anxiety_3, while post_registration.json lists three focal claims including (A) older people estimate risk lower, (B) women more concerned than men, (C) worry about public places. The local dataset lacks an age variable and perceived risk variables needed to replicate claim (A) about age. However, the data and R script do contain variables (female, mh_anxiety_1, mh_anxiety_3) and analysis steps that match claim (B) about gender differences (women more concerned). I therefore plan a replication targeting the gender-difference claim (women > men on anxiety / concern) using the local data. I translated the R analysis into Python and wrote a Python script at ./data/original/4/python/replication_data/Gerhold_covid_Azg9_0948_final__py.py that reads the local CSV from /app/data, runs the same filtering, F-tests, equal-variance t-tests, and Cohen's d, and saves results to /app/data/original/4/python/replication_data/replication_results.json.

The replication will use the full local CSV; any further subsetting (e.g., to Germany only) will be documented in notes and code.",
      "sample_size": "Raw rows in local CSV: 10,192 rows (dataset shape reported). Analytic sample after filtering gender != 3 will be reported by the script at runtime (script writes n_total, n_female, n_male to replication_results.json).",

        "explanation": "This local dataset contains the key variables required to test the gender-difference claim (female indicator and mh_anxiety_1, mh_anxiety_3 anxiety items). The R script included in replication_data specifically performs t-tests on mh_anxiety_1 and mh_anxiety_3 by female vs male, which aligns with the 'women are more concerned' claim in post_registration.json. Therefore the data are qualified to replicate the gender-based claim.",
        "similarity_to_original": "Evidence that this dataset is high-fidelity to the original: (1) post_registration.json documents the focal study as an online survey with anxiety / coping items (see ./data/original/4/python/post_registration.json 'method' and 'outcome_variable'); (2) the replication R script header and code (./data/original/4/python/replication_data/Gerhold_covid_Azg9_0948_final.R) import a file named data_gerhold.csv and run t-tests on mh_anxiety_1 and mh_anxiety_3 by female, matching the variables available in the local CSV (./data/original/4/python/replication_data/data_gerhold.csv). These matches indicate high fidelity for the gender-difference claim.",

The local CSV contains 10,192 rows (./data/original/4/python/replication_data/data_gerhold.csv) which is substantially larger — likely a different aggregation (multi-country or pooled) or an earlier/later, expanded dataset; (2) the original focal claim about age (older respondents report lower perceived infection likelihood) requires age and specific perceived-risk items, but the local CSV does not contain an 'age' column or explicit perceived-risk items (local columns are: CountryofLiving, gender, mh_anxiety_1, mh_anxiety_3, weight_sample, weight_new, female). Thus we cannot replicate the age-based claim from this CSV.

        ]

(2) The local CSV appears substantially larger than the sample described in post_registration.json (n=1242); verify whether the local dataset is pooled across countries or waves. (3) Weight variables are present (weight_sample, weight_new) — the original analyses in post_registration.json do not describe using weights; replication will follow the original R script (no weighting) but results can be rerun with weights if desired. (4) Variable formatting: gender and female columns exist; code coerces these to numeric. Missing values are handled by listwise deletion in the script."

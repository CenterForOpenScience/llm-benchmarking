  "interpretation_summary": "I inspected the preregistration and the executed replication. The team translated the original R analysis into Python, built a Docker runtime, executed the translated script, and extracted results. The replication tested the preregistered gender-difference claim (women report higher COVID-19 anxiety) using the same basic statistical approach as the R script (F-test for equality of variances, equal-variance two-sample t-test, and Cohen's d). The replication found female > male means on the focal item (mh_anxiety_1): mean_female = 3.0748 vs mean_male = 2.8896 (difference \u2248 0.1852), t = 8.2527, p \u2248 1.74e-16, Cohen's d = 0.1645 (small). A secondary item (mh_anxiety_3) also showed female > male with a very small effect (d = 0.053, p \u2248 0.00787). Overall fidelity to the planned methods was high (same tests and variables), but the analytic dataset used in the replication (n_total = 10,071) is much larger than the originally reported analytic sample (~1,242), which likely explains extremely small p-values despite small effect sizes. The final outcome: the replication supports the preregistered directional claim (women report higher anxiety) but with small effect sizes and results sensitive to the much larger sample size used in the replication.",

  "notes": "Key caveats: (1) The replication used a much larger dataset (n=10,071) than the original paper's reported analytic sample (~1,242). This inflates power and makes tiny effects statistically significant; report and interpret effect sizes and confidence intervals (not only p-values). (2) The replication computed t-tests without covariate adjustment \u2014 consistent with the original descriptive approach \u2014 but further multivariate checks (e.g., controlling for age, region) could help assess robustness. (3) Recommend computing and reporting 95% confidence intervals for mean differences and SEs (script currently reports t-stats and p-values but not CIs). (4) For medium/hard verification, re-run analysis using the original sample or a matched subset and confirm variable coding (female flag, NA treatment)."

  "execution_summary": "I translated the original R analysis into Python, built a Docker environment, ran the replication script inside the container, and produced results. Key steps: generated a Dockerfile, fixed syntax in the Dockerfile, built the image, started the container, translated the R script to replication_data/Gerhold_covid_Azg9_0948_final__py.py, added a top-level main.py entrypoint, updated replication_info.json, obtained human approval, and executed python main.py inside the container. The script performed filtering (gender != 3), computed group means, F-tests for variance equality, equal-variance two-sample t-tests, and Cohen's d effect sizes for mh_anxiety_1 (primary) and mh_anxiety_3 (secondary). No major deviations from the planned method occurred other than adapting file paths for the container environment and adding robustness for locating data and creating output directories. The analysis completed successfully and wrote replication_results.json. The dataset used appears larger than the originally registered sample (10,071 vs ~1,242), as noted in replication_info.json.",

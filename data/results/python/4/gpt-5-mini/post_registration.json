      "description": "A cross-sectional quantitative online survey administered through an ISO-certified panel provider. The questionnaire included measures of cognitive and affective risk perception (three likelihood items; seven fear/insecurity items), 30 psychometric items based on the psychometric paradigm (dread and unknown risk dimensions), 28 coping items (problem-focused and emotion-focused, based on a German adaptation of the Ways of Coping Scale) plus seven concrete behavior items, four trust items, and ten questions on emergency food preparedness. All questions were mandatory. After data collection, respondents who completed the survey too quickly (<7 minutes) were removed and scales were computed (including checks of internal consistency with Cronbach's \u03b1). Analyses reported are descriptive statistics (means, SDs, percentages), reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1), group comparisons (gender differences, t-tests or equivalent reported with p-values), and correlations (Pearson r where reported).",

      "summary": "Key findings: Older respondents estimate their personal risk of COVID-19 infection as lower than younger respondents. Women report more worry and greater endorsement of coping strategies than men. The German population perceives COVID-19 as a serious, novel, globally consequential threat but also believes it is to some extent controllable. Coping strategies are predominantly problem-focused (listening to experts, thinking carefully, avoiding rash actions). High proportions reported behavior changes: ~87% wash/disinfect hands more, ~87% avoid public places, ~85% avoid public transport. About 41.9% reported buying more food supplies than usual; approximately 50% store food for 10\u201311 days. Trust is highest in hospitals/emergency services and authorities/medical experts; lower trust in politics.",

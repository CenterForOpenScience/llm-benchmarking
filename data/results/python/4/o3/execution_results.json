After building a Python-only environment (Python 3.10-slim with pandas, numpy, scipy) and fixing a minor typo in replicate_claim.py, we ran the analysis script. The script loaded the 10,192-case German COVID-19 survey, filtered to valid male/female respondents, computed descriptive statistics, performed Levene\u2019s test, an independent-samples t-test, and calculated Cohen\u2019s d. The analysis reproduced the focal claim: women reported significantly higher COVID-19 worry than men.",

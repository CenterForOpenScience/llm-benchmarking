Abstract 
This paper presents preliminary results of a representative survey of the German population focusing on 
perceptions of risk and way s of coping with C OVID-19. Results show that older people estimate the risk 
of COVID-19 as being less than younger people. Women are more concerned about COVID-19 than men. 
People especially worry about being infected in places with high public traffic such as public transport and 
shops or restaurants.  
Coping strategies are highly problem -focused and most respondents listen to experts’  advice and try to 
behave calmly and appropriately. People accept that  measures to tackle COVID-19 will take time to be 
effective. Bulk buying and s toring of food is mainly justified by a combination of convenience and a 
perceived need to be prepared for potential quarantine.  
1. Research question  
With regard to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, this study aims to understand how the German population are 
perceiving and coping with the situation. The main research questions are:  
1. How do people in Germany perceive the risk of being infected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS-
CoV-2)?  
2. How do people cope with the risk of being infected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS -CoV-2) 
and the pandemic as such?  
3. Are people changing their behavior with regard to the coronavirus disease – for example, are they 
storing food? 
The survey therefore comprises three main section

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the preregistered plan almost completely: the python script loaded the large German COVID-19 survey, restricted to male/female respondents, and ran the pre-specified Levene test, independent-samples t-test, and Cohen\u2019s d. Execution finished without error and produced clear output. Like the original study (Gerhold 2020), the replication finds that women report higher general worry about COVID-19 than men, and the difference is highly significant (t = 8.25, p \u2248 1.7 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076). Although the replication operationalised worry as the 5-point Likert mean (rather than the binary \u2018agree/strongly agree\u2019 share used in the paper), the direction and statistical significance match the original claim. Effect size is small (d = 0.165) but similar in sign to the original 12.5 pp gap. Overall, the replication supports the focal hypothesis.",

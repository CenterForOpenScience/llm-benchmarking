  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed successfully after minor path and gender-coding fixes. Using the Gerhold_covid_Azg9_0948 dataset (German adults), the planned tests were run: (1) mean difference in worry (mh_anxiety_1) and (2) difference in agree-rate (Likert 4\u20135). Results show women report higher mean worry than men (diff\u22480.185 on 1\u20135 scale, p<0.001, small d\u22480.165), consistent with the hypothesized direction. However, the agree-rate difference was essentially zero and non-significant, diverging from the original report where women\u2019s agreement was substantially higher (68.2% vs 55.7%, p<0.01). Overall, the replication provides partial support: directionally consistent on means but not on dichotomized agreement.",

Reporting weighted estimates and verifying identical item wording would improve comparability."

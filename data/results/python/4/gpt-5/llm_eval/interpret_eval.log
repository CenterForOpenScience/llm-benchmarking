Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

Replication of a research claim from Seaton et al. (2010), from the Journal of 
Environmental Psychology 
 
Claim Summary 
The claim selected for replication from Gerhold (2020) is that women are more concerned about 
COVID-19 than men. This reflects the following statement from the paper's abstract: "Women 
are more concerned about COVID-19 than men." This claim was tested by comparing 
agreement to the statement “The COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) worries me” between 
men and women, measured using a 5-point Likert Scale. Further details are not described in the 
original manuscript. The authors found that women are more worried about COVID-19 in 
general than men (women=68.2%, men=55.7%, p < .01). We attempt to replicate the focal 
claim made by Gerhold (2020) by using data collected by Fetzer et al. (2020). Fetzer et al.’s 
data set also contains information on worries, as well as gender, age, and other demographic 
information. The focal claim was tested using a Student’s independent samples t-test. Given that 
the original article did not propose a directional hypothesis, the replication attempt replies on a 
two-tailed test. 
 
Replication Criteria 
Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project is a statistically significant 
effect (alpha = .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal hypothesis 
test (H*). The hypothesis to be tested is: Women will express more concern about COVID-19 
than men. As such, the inference criteria that will be used to assess whether the focal claim 
replicates will be the p-value derived from a t-test that examines if females and males differ with 
regard to “mh_anxiety_1” scores. Specifically, a p-value less than .05 will indicate that a gender 
difference exists. The respective female average score must also be greater than the respective 
male average score.  
 
Replication Result 
The replication included 10,071 individuals (5,138 males and 4,933 females) in the analytic 
sample to reach the requirements for Stage 1 data collection (see Section 13 of preregistration 
form at https://osf.io/ms2ra/). An independent samples t-test revealed that the 4,933 females (M 

3 
 
= 3.08, SD = 1.11) exhibited significantly higher concern regarding COVID-19 than the 5,138 
males (M = 2.89, SD = 1.14), t (10,069) = 8.2527, p < .001 (p = 1.742986e-16). Thus, this 
replication of the claim was successful according to the SCORE criteria. 
 
Unfortunately, we are unable to produce a Cohen’s d for the original result due to sparse 
reporting in the original article. Specifically, because respective men and women averages were 
not reported in the original article and the replication team does not have access to the original 
study's raw data, a Cohen’s d that captures the men versus women mean difference with regard 
to “mh_anxiety_1” cannot be estimated. However, according to the power analysis conducted by 
the SCORE team (see “POWER_Gerhold_covid_Azg9.md” at https://osf.io/aynsm/), the 
estimated Cohen’s d for the original study’s focal claim is d = 0.1464., which indicates that 
women experienced greater worry than men. The replication yielded a positive Cohen’s d in the 
focal test (d = 0.164609), corresponding to an effect in the same pattern compared to the original 
study.

Deviations from the Original Study  
The main deviation from the original study is that the data on worries in Fetzer et al. (2020) 
does not explicitly ask for worries regarding COVID-19. In the original study, the question 
asks to what extent respondents agree with the statement: “The COVID-19 (Coronavirus 
SARS-CoV-2) worries me.” In the replication dataset, respondents were asked the extent to 
which the following statements apply to them: (1) “I am nervous when I think about current 
circumstances” and (2) “I am worried about my health.” Apart from this, there is no other 
deviation from the original study.

Replication Dataset Access/License Information 
We are thankful to Fetzer et al. for making their data set, which facilitated the current replication 
analysis, freely available via their OSF repository (see https://osf.io/3sn2k/). According to the 
repository, researchers can download and use the data set if they agree to comply with the 
European Union's GDPR requirements and a set of other requirements outlined on the repository 
homepage. In addition, according to the Fetzer et al.’s https://covid19-survey.org/ website, the 
anonymized data is available for non-commercial research use (License: CC-By Attribution 4.0 
International). Thus, the data can be shared on our project page (see https://osf.io/a7h9n/ with 
attribution to Fetzer et al. 
 
Data Overlap Disclosure 
This statement confirms that there was no overlap between the original and replication datasets. 
Specifically, the two datasets were independent.

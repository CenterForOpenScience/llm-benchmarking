Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The extracted information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelated information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The extracted information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The extracted information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

Instructions for Data Analysts 
 
The preregistration for this replication study was started by a separate team of researchers who were 
responsible for identifying data sources and constructing them into a replication dataset(s) for your use in 
the analysis. They have completed sections 1-13 of the preregistration below, and included additional 
materials in the OSF project that document how the dataset was constructed.  
 
In cases where all of the underlying data sources were able to be freely shared and posted, the 
constructed dataset(s) have been posted to the OSF as well, which you are free to use in designing the 
analysis plan (see below for details). In cases where some or all of the data sources could not be freely 
shared or posted, the replication dataset(s) are not provided on the OSF. Rather, you will need to follow 
the instructions and code to first reconstruct the datasets, and then proceed with your work. In such 
cases, the team responsible for creating the dataset(s) has provided summary statistics in the OSF that 
correspond to the constructed datasets, so you can verify that the datasets you create match what they 
intended. 
 
You’ll be responsible for filling out sections 16-25 of the preregistration below. Before you do so, please 
review the original study, sections 1-15 of the preregistration, and the materials provided on the 
OSF, so that you are familiar with all of the decisions that have been made to date. In many cases, the 
‘data preparer’ will have left you instructions and suggestions on how the provided data can be used in 
the analysis, as well as idiosyncrasies and discrepancies in the data that you should be aware of. The 
data preparers have tried to be thorough in including all variables that you might need, but please keep in 
mind the following: 
● 
Some of the variables included in the constructed dataset(s) may not be needed in the final 
analysis, so please do not feel the need to necessarily use all of the provided variables. 
● 
Some of the variables needed might have mistakenly been excluded from the constructed 
datasets. If you find that this is the case, please let Andrew or Anna know, and they will work with 
you to supplement the datasets as needed. 
 
For these secondary data replications, we would like the analysis plan to be completed before the 
preregistration goes through review, so that after review, the only remaining steps are registration and 
running the analysis code on the full datasets. To facilitate that, we are asking that you include in section 
19 a link to the code you will use that takes the constructed dataset(s) provided to you and produces the 
focal analysis (including all of the cleaning, merging, and transforming required). When developing your 
analysis plan and code, please randomly sample 5% of the data for use in your work, and do not use the 
rest of the data until it is time to run the final analysis. In section 19, you will find a statement that we 
are asking you to bold that confirms you’ve only used 5% of the data when developing and testing your 
code. If this approach will not work for any reason, please let Andrew or Anna know and disclose 
deviations from this plan somewhere in the preregistration. 
● 
In cases where we are providing you a complete dataset, you can just sample out 5% of the 
observations and hold the rest out until you are ready to perform the final analysis. 
● 
In cases where we are providing you multiple datasets that need to be combined prior to analysis, 
please sample out 5% of the observations in whatever way is most sensible.  
○ 
For example, in cases where each dataset contains complete observations on its own (a 
typical 'row bind' situation), it makes the most sense to sample out 5% of each dataset 
separately and then combine them together to develop and test your code.  
○ 
In cases where datasets need to be merged in order to create complete observations (a 
typical 'column bind' situation), it makes the most sense to merge the separate datasets 
Commented [1]: This characterizes the Gerhold 
replication. 
Commented [2]: OK. 

 
into a full dataset first, and then sample out the 5% before proceeding with the rest of the 
analysis code. 
● 
We leave the decision on how to sample out the random subset of data to you, so long as (a) you 
are not performing any analyses on the complete dataset until after your study is registered and 
(b) whatever decision you make is documented in the preregistration. 
 
Finally, in cases where the replication data combines observations from the original study with 
observations that were not used in the original study (what we are calling ‘hybrid replications’), please 
perform two analyses (details immediately below). This will likely require you to subset your data into the 
two groups described immediately below, based on the description of the original analysis provided in the 
study. 
● 
When the ‘new’ data alone can clear the minimum power threshold, please perform one analysis 
that combines all available data, and a second that only uses the ‘new’ data. Please make sure 
both analyses are documented (with code) in section 19 below. 
● 
When the ‘new’ data alone cannot clear the minimum power threshold, please perform one 
analysis that combines all available data, and a second that only uses the old data. Please make 
sure both analyses are documented (with code) in section 19 below. 
 
Please contact Andrew or Anna if you have any questions. After you’ve completed the remaining 
sections of the preregistration and uploaded all the necessary materials to the OSF, please 
contact the SCORE coordinators regarding next steps. 
 
Commented [3]: This does not apply to the Gerhold 
replication, so this paragraph can be ignored. 
Commented [4]: OK 

 
Preregistration of Gerhold_covid_Azg9 
Existing Data Replication 
Study Information 
1. Title (provided by SCORE) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This has been determined by SCORE. 
 
Replication of a research claim from Gerhold (2020). 
 
2. Authors and affiliations   
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Fill in the names and affiliations of your team below. 
 
Anirudh Tagat1 
Hansika Kapoor2 
 
 
1 Department of Economics, Monk Prayogshala, Mumbai 
2 Department of Psychology, Monk Prayogshala, Mumbai 
 
3. Description of study (provided by SCORE) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This description has been provided by SCORE. Please review and 
make a SCORE project coordinator aware of any edits, additions, and corrections you would 
suggest to the paragraph. You are free to add additional descriptions of your project in a 
separate paragraph.  
 
The claim selected for replication from Gerhold (2020) is that women are more concerned about 
COVID-19 than men. This reflects the following statement from the paper's abstract: "Women 
are more concerned about COVID-19 than men." This claim was tested by comparing 
agreement to the statement “The COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) worries me” between 
men and women, measured using a 5-point Likert Scale. Further details are not described in the 
original manuscript. The authors found that they are worried about COVID-19 in general 
(women=68.2%, men=55.7%, p < .01). 
 
4. Hypotheses (provided by SCORE with possible Data Analyst additions) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: The focal test for SCORE is indicated as H*. If you will test 
additional hypotheses (or use alternate analyses) that help you to evaluate the claim your 
replication/reproduction is testing, number them H1, H2, H3 etc. (You can place H* in the list 
wherever makes sense). Please make sure that any additional hypotheses are logical 

 
deductions/operationalizations of the selected SCORE claim or are necessary to properly 
interpret the focal H* hypothesis.  Research that is outside this scope should be described in a 
separate preregistration. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Are the listed hypotheses specific, concise, clearly testable, and specified at the level of 
operationalized variables?  
● Are hypotheses identified as directional or non-directional, and, if applicable, have the 
direction of hypotheses been stated? (Example: “Customers’ mean choice satisfaction 
will be higher in the CvSS architecture condition than in the standard attribute-by- 
attribute architecture condition.”) 
● Does the list of hypotheses/tests indicate whether additional hypotheses are taken from 
the original study or modified/added by the team? 
 
H*: Women will express more concern about COVID-19 than men. 
 
 
 

 
Design Plan 
5. Study type 
NOTE: The study type selected should be based on the data collected for the replication, and 
not necessarily the data used in the original study. 
 
● Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes 
field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes 
randomized controlled trials. 
● Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly 
assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, natural experiments, and 
regression discontinuity designs. 
● Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies. 
● Other  
 
6. Blinding 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Select any/all of the below that apply for your study by bolding 
them. You will give a longer description in the next question. 
 
● No blinding is involved in this study. 
● For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which 
they have been assigned. 
● Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human 
subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments. (Commonly known as “double 
blind”) 
● Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the treatment 
applied to any given group. 
 
[QUESTION 6 - BOLD YOUR RESPONSE ABOVE] 
 
7. Blinding 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Since all existing data replications are based on data that has 
already been collected, in most cases it will not be necessary to comment on participant 
blinding. In the rare instance when an existing experiment is being re-analyzed for an existing 
data replication and blinding is a relevant consideration, please provide below any details 
regarding blinding that are important for a reviewer to be aware of. 
 
No blinding was involved to the secondary data collectors’ knowledge. 

 
8. Study Design 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Please describe how data was collected in the original study and 
how it compares to the data that was selected for the replication attempt. Explain why the data 
selected for the replication study is suitable for a replication and if any substantial deviations 
exist between the two. 
 
If the data used in the replication combines observations from the original study with new 
observations (e.g. if the data selected for the replication attempt comes from the same 
longitudinal survey as the original study), describe how ‘original’ and ‘new’ observations relate to 
each other and an estimate for what proportion of the final dataset’s observations will be 
comprised of original vs. new observations. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration specify the unit of analysis? 
● Does the preregistration provide sufficient detail about how the data selected for the 
replication attempt deviates from or is congruent with the data employed in the original 
study? 
● Does the preregistration describe whether and how ‘original’ and ‘new observations’ are 
combined together for the replication dataset? 
 
The data was collected online from a German sample between 19 and 23 March, 2020. All 
respondents to the online survey were above 18 years of age and did not have COVID-19 (as 
far as they were aware). Of the 1300 respondents, 1242 remained in the analysis (the author 
only retained data from respondents who took more than seven minutes to complete the 
questionnaire), and all major regions of the country were represented, with the average age of 
participants being 46 years.  
 
For replication, we propose to use data collected by Fetzer et al. (2020) that was deployed 
online starting March 20, 2020 and has at least 200 respondents from 58 countries. Their 
dataset also contains information on worries, as well as gender, age, and other demographic 
information. As of May 2020, the proposed replication dataset has 10,192 respondents to the 
online survey from Germany alone, but data on sub-national regions is not available. The main 
deviation from the original study is that the data on worries in Fetzer et al. (2020) does not 
explicitly ask for worries regarding COVID-19.  
 
In the original study, the question asks to what extent respondents agree with the statement: 
“The COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) worries me.” In the proposed replication dataset, 
the question asks the extent to which the following statement applies to the respondent: “I am 
nervous when I think about current circumstances.” The other question that will be used is “I am 
worried about my health.” Apart from this, there is no other deviation from the original study. 
Data from the original study and Fetzer et al. (2020) will not be combined for replication. 
 

 
9. Randomization (free response) 
 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: If the variables used for this replication attempt were randomized, 
state how they were randomized, and at what level. 
 
NA. There is no publicly available information about randomization. 
 
Sampling Plan 
 
This section describes how the data sources for the replication were selected, how they were 
prepared into a replication dataset, and the number of observations that will be analyzed from 
these data. Please keep in mind that the data described in this section are the actual data used 
for analysis, so if you are using a subset of a larger dataset, please describe the subset that will 
actually be used in your study. 
10. Existing data (multiple choice question, provided by SCORE) 
1.1.1. 
Registration prior to creation of data 
1.1.2. 
Registration prior to any human observation of the data 
1.1.3. 
Registration prior to accessing the data 
1.1.4. 
Registration prior to analysis of the data 
1.1.5. 
Registration following analysis of the data 
 
11. Explanation of existing data 
NOTE: For replications that rely on existing data sources, this question refers to the data that 
will be used for the replication analysis (i.e. the final replication dataset), and not (a) the data 
from the original study or (b) the data sources accessed to construct the replication dataset. 
Since no new data will be created for ‘existing data replications,’ 1.1.1 should never be selected. 
Since all analyses will occur after registration, 1.1.5 should also never be selected. 
 
The data from Fetzer et al. (2020) has been accessed and prepared to match the sample 
criteria (German sample) prior to registration. The variables were selected to match with the 
requirements of the focal claim to be replicated. These are two measures on worry related to 
COVID-19, and one variable on gender of the respondent. 
12. Data collection procedures 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Please describe the process for constructing the replication 
dataset in as much detail as you can. The sections below should be used to provide the 
following information: 

 
● Which variables are needed from the original study to perform a good-faith, high-quality 
replication.  
● Which data sources were used, why they were selected, any deviations between the 
original study design and the replication study design that these selections present, and 
the procedures used to access the data. 
● Which of the variables from the original study are available in the replication data 
sources, including relevant details about each measure. 
● The procedure for creating the replication dataset, in both narrative and script form. 
● A data dictionary that documents each variable included in the replication dataset. 
 
In the sections below, please provide links to the original materials whenever possible -- 
including descriptions of the original datasets and corresponding codebooks. If materials can be 
shared on the OSF, please do so, and provide view-only links to those materials. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind for reviewers: 
● Does the preregistration describe which data sources were selected for the replication 
study and why each is suitable? 
● Does the preregistration make clear how the data sources were used to construct the 
replication dataset? 
(a) Data Needed 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: List below the datasets and variables the original author used to 
analyze the focal claim. Include details regarding the sample size, waves or years used, and 
other details pertinent to finding an existing dataset for replication. Please include page 
numbers when excerpting from the original article. If possible, categorize the list of variables as 
one of the following: dependent variable, focal independent variable, control variable, or sample 
parameters/clustering variable. Finally, include the sample size of the original study’s focal 
analysis, if it is available.

Sample Parameters 
 
Sample size of analysis has 1242 observations.  
  
(b) Data Access 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:  Describe below the data sources that will provide the replication 
variables. Include information such as the name of the data source (e.g., Indonesian Family Life 
Survey), the description and link of the data source, and the waves needed to create a final 
replication dataset.  
 
Also describe the process for accessing the data sources that will be used to create the final 
replication dataset; specify how long long it took for the registration to be approved and what 
information was required (e.g., writeup of the purpose of the project, email address from an 
IPCSR institution, etc.); and verify that the data can be opened as expected. If applicable, 
provide a link to the page where you registered to access the data. 
 
Describe in detail any restrictions on data access and data-sharing, as well as any additional 
terms of data use that will be relevant for the replication study and final report (e.g. citations that 
will need to be made). If you were able to access the data because of special permissions that 
you have, but that you expect other researchers might not have, please document those as well. 
 
The dataset from Fetzer et al. (2020) is openly available and accessed via OSF at this link. In 
order to the use the dataset, authors must agree to the following GDPR-related statements: 
By downloading and using the dataset, you agree to comply with the European Union's GDPR 
requirements, as well as the following: 
— My research team and I will only use the data for research, and not for commercial purposes 
— My research team and I will not attempt to identify individuals using these data 
— My research team and I will share the resulting pre-print/publication with the researchers 
— My research team and I will cite the dataset using the citation below.  
 
Additionally, the dataset must be cited if being used in the replication. Other than this, there are 
no restrictions on data access and sharing. 
 
 
(c) Variable Availability 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: For each variable required for the replication analysis (listed 
above), describe the variables from the replication data that can be used to measure it 
(including which data files or sources each measure is found in), any notes a data analyst 
should consider when using the measure in a replication analysis, and any important 
differences between the original variable and the proposed replication variable. 
 

 
If there are multiple variables in the replication data that correspond to a required variable (e.g. 
two different measures of education in the replication data), include all of those options below. If 
a variable from the original study cannot be measured using the replication data, please make 
that clear as well. Finally, include a description of the identifiers used to merge multiple 
datasets, if applicable. 
 
Fear of being infected by COVID-19 
● Dataset: “GlobalBehaviorsPerceptions_Data_May21_2020.dta” 
● Variable name: mh_anxiety_1: “I am nervous when I think about current circumstances” 
● Variable name: mh_anxiety_3: “I am worried about my health” 
● Notes: These questions do not explicitly ask about worries related to COVID-19, but are 
positioned in a survey on COVID-19, so it may be assumed that respondents view this 
question about “current circumstances” to be the same as “COVID-19”. The response is 
measured in a 5-point scale: “Does not apply at all” (value 1) to “Strongly applies” (value 
5). 
 
Gender 
● Dataset: “GlobalBehaviorsPerceptions_Data_May21_2020.dta” 
● Variable gender: “Selected choice” 
● Takes three values: 1 “Female” 2 “Male” and 3 “Other”; For purposes of analysis (t-test), 
indicator variable for female can be created or “Other” values can be set to missing. 
 
Sample weights: 
● Dataset: “GlobalBehaviorsPerceptions_Data_May21_2020.dta” 
● Variable: weight_new 
● Variable: weight_sample 
● Is a continuous variable. 
● Notes: Fetzer et al. (2020) provide population weights by country as well as sample 
weights. See Section 3 of the data documentation file available here for details on how 
weights were computed. 
(d) Data Creation 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Create a dataset using the data sources and variables listed 
above. Provide a detailed narrative describing how the various datasets were cleaned and 
merged into a final replication dataset. Provide a view-only link to a clearly commented script on 
the OSF that produces the replication data as described in the narrative. Our preference is that 
this be either an R script or a script from another language that similarly allows for open and 
reproducible analyses. Please let the SCORE team know if this is not possible. 
● If the data can be freely shared and posted to OSF, please post it in your OSF project 
and provide a link to the completed dataset below. 
● If any part of the dataset cannot be shared between researchers or posted to the OSF, 
please leave the final dataset off the OSF. Instead, include either below or in your script 
(commented out at the bottom) two pieces of information that will help an independent 
team verify they have created the dataset according to your instructions: 
Commented [5]: If there are at least 20 cases in the 
third group, ANOVA should be used. If only a few 
cases describe themselves as the members of the third 
group, they should be mentioned aside from the main 
analysis. 
Commented [6]: We agreed that it will be best to 
examine a female vs. male difference because that is 
what was done in the original study. 

 
○ The dimensions of the final dataset(s) you’ve created (# of rows, # of columns) 
○ A summary of 8-10 variables in the replication dataset. For numeric variables, the 
summary should include the mean, standard deviation, and count of NAs. For 
categorical variables, the summary should include each level present in the data 
and its count, as well as a count of NAs. If multiple datasets are submitted as 
part of your work, at least one variable should be included from each dataset. 
 
The data from the replication sources should be preserved in as ‘raw’ a form as possible, in 
order to give the data analyst the most latitude to clean the variables as they see fit. Variables 
from the original source should be preserved in their original form (e.g. do not recode values of 
99 to NA). New variables should only be created when they’re needed to complete the merge or 
combine the datasets; in those cases, please preserve a version of the original, unaltered 
variable in the new dataset.  
 
When combining multiple datasets by binding rows, please be sure that the data type and 
measurement units are equivalent across each dataset. If there is a discrepancy in how a 
variable is measured across datasets, rename the variable in each dataset to indicate the 
original dataset, and then carefully document the resulting measures below and in the data 
dictionary. See here for an example of how this should work. 
 
Please also use this section to describe: 
● Any deviations between the original study design and the replication design that would 
result from using this replication dataset. 
● Any notes about using these variables that you would like to pass along to the data 
analyst.

The summary statistics for gender, the categorical variable is as below: 
Male (5,138); Female (4,933); and other (121). There are no missing/NA observations. 
 
The replication attempt will require a new categorical variable for female, which takes a value of 
1 if the respondent is female and zero if the respondent is male (in the original study, there was 
only a binary response for gender). This is included in the code. The original variable from the 
replication dataset is preserved as is. It will also require computation of the sample weights 
using the procedure laid out in Fetzer et al. (2020). 
 
In the original study, the focal claim appears to have been tested using a binary variable for 
worry about COVID-19 [“62.1% agree (answering either with “strongly agree” or “agree” on the 
5-point Likert Scale) that they are worried about COVID-19 in general (women=68.2%, 
men=55.7%, p < .01),” p.5]. However, details of the statistical test applied are not available in 
the paper or otherwise. Therefore, in the replication attempt, it may be useful to conduct an 
independent samples t-test between males and females using the “raw” versions of the 
variables (scales from 1 to 5) rather than creating a binary variable. Alternatively, if a binary 
variable is desirable, a chi-squared test is appropriate. The resulting binary variable can take a 
value of 1 if the worries variable takes a value of 4 [Somewhat applies] or 5 [Strongly applies], 
and a value of 0 if the worries variable takes a value of 1 [Does not apply at all] or 2 
[Somewhat/Does not apply]. The details are provided in the code. 
 
(e) Data Dictionary 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Create a data dictionary following this template. Provide below a 
view-only link to the completed data dictionary included in the OSF project. If the Data Analyst 
will need to create new variables using the variables in the final replication dataset (e.g. 
recoding the provided education variable to be in a better format for analysis), please document 
below your recommendation on how the analyst should do so. Please also document any 
additional notes regarding the variables in the dataset that do not fit within the provided data 
dictionary template or the other sections above. 
 
The data dictionary can be found here: https://osf.io/b3qxz/ 

 
13. Sample size 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Please report below the analytic sample size(s) in the replication 
dataset, with reference to however many units or levels are in the data. Please report as much 
information here as will be helpful for the review committee to be aware of, including differences 
in sample size resulting from various analytic decisions (e.g. listwise deletion vs multiple 
imputation). Finally, when the replication combines observations from the original study 
with new observations, please estimate what proportion of the analytic sample’s 
observations will be comprised of original vs. new observations. 
 
Data finders’ response goes here: 
 
Sample parameters (Germany): 
 
● mh_anxiety_1 (Worry about current circumstances): 10,192 non-missing observations 
(10,192 total) 
● mh_anxiety_3 (worry about my health): 10,192 non-missing observations (10,192 total) 
● gender (female): 10,192 non-missing observations (10,192 total) 
● gender (female indicator variable): 10,071 non-missing observations (10,192 total) 
● weight_new (within country weights, based on share of popn): 10,192 non-missing 
observations (10,192 total) 
● weight_sample (within country weights): 10,192 non-missing observations (10,192 total) 
 
------ 
 
Required sample size [to be filled out by the SCORE team]: The primary unit of analysis is the 
respondent. An estimate of the minimum viable sample size for the data analytic replication is: 
720. For comparison, the stage1 required sample size would be: 3488 and the stage2 sample 
size would be: 7844. 
 
Notes on the power analysis: The original authors said they ‘usually use t-Test and Anova for 
comparing mean values’, but did not provide any specifics on the test statistic or df values when 
contacted by the SCORE team. This power analysis assumes a t-test here, and used the p<.01 
from the claim as a p-value threshold and then back calculated a t-value and d value from there. 
There would be the ‘worst case’ values, meaning the sample size is very conservative and 
would likely ‘overpower’ the study based on its true t and d values, which are likely larger than 
those back-calculated here. The power analysis also assumes equal or very close to equal N for 
male and female respondents. 
 
14. Sample size rationale 
 
For data analytic replications in SCORE, three sample sizes are calculated: 

 
● A minimum threshold sample size, defined as the sample size required for 50% power of 
100% of the original effect 
● A stage 1 sample size, defined as the sample size needed to have 90% power to detect 
75% of the original effect 
● A stage 2 sample size, defined as the sample size needed to have 90% power to detect 
50% of the original effect 
Details about how those sample sizes were calculated for this project are found here. 
 
 
15. Stopping rule (provided by SCORE) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Because all existing data replications that clear SCORE’s 
minimum power threshold will proceed to analysis, the stopping rule is not relevant for these 
kinds of projects. 
 
N/A -- all observations will be used in a single analysis. 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Variables 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: The preregistration form divides variables across three questions: 
manipulated variables, measured variables, and indices (i.e. analytic variables derived from raw 
variables). For existing data replications, only fill out the “Measured variables’ and ‘Indices’ 
sections. Please do not fill out anything in the ‘Manipulated variables’ section.  
 
The raw data of any transformed variable (e.g. reaction time → log reaction time) or any created 
index should be defined in the ‘Measured variables’ section. Details regarding the variable 
transformation should be specified in the ‘Transformations’ section. Details regarding the 
creation of an index should be specified in the ‘Indices’ section.  
 
Across these questions, you should define all variables that will later be used during your 
analysis (including data preparation/processing). You can describe all variables in the 
preregistration and/or summarize and link to a data dictionary (codebook) in your repository to 
answer these questions. 
 
If you will share data from your replication, this is also the place to state whether any variables 
will be removed prior to sharing the dataset (e.g. to reduce risk of participant identification or 
comply with copyright restrictions on scale items.)   
 
16. Manipulated variables 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Manipulated variables in this preregistration refer specifically to 
variables that have been randomly assigned in an experiment. The use of data from an 
experiment should be rare in existing data replications. If your existing data replication relies on 
experimental data, please document each manipulated variable as a measured variable, and 
use the codebook to indicate what each level of the variable corresponds to (e.g. participants 
assigned to the treatment condition = 1; participants assigned to the control condition = 0). The 
default language in bold below has been copied into all existing data replication preregistrations.  
 
N/A -- not documented for existing data replications. 
 
17. Measured variables 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: Please use this section to document each variable that was used 
in the original study’s analysis and the role it served (e.g. dependent variable, control variable, 
sample parameter, etc). For each variable, provide the description of the variable offered in the 
paper and/or codebook of the original study, the variable in the replication dataset that it 
corresponds to, and explain any deviations between the two. In cases where an equivalent 
replication variable was not found, explain how, if at all, you expect it will affect the replication 

 
attempt. In cases where you are adding a variable that was not present in the original study, 
please explicitly state that you are doing so, and explain how, if at all, you expect it will affect the 
replication attempt. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration surface all of the variables needed to replicate the focal 
analysis? 
● Are deviations between the original variables and replication variables documented 
when needed? 
VARIABLE #1: GENDER (I.E., FEMALE) 
● These data will be used to conduct a t-test to examine the replicability of the focal claim. 
Specifically, the “female” data from the Fetzer et al. (2020) data set will be used to 
ascertain if a female versus male mean difference exists with regard to scores on 
“mh_anxiety_1” ("I am nervous when I think about the current circumstances"). 
● A formal description of this variable was not provided in the original study. In addition, 
the survey item and the corresponding response options used to collect these data were 
not provided in the original study. 
● A dummy vector where 0 = male and 1 = female has been provided in the replication 
data set (i.e.,Fetzer et al. [2020]). This categorical variable will be used to examine if 
group differences (i.e., female vs. male) exist. 
● It appears has if the original study (Gerhold, 2020) asked individuals to indicate if they 
were female or male (i.e., two response options). In contrast, in the replication study 
(Fetzer et al., 2020) respondents were asked to indicate if they identified as female, 
male, or other (i.e., three response options). 121 individuals identified as other. 
However, given that the original study examined female versus male differences, data 
pertaining to these 121 individuals was marked as missing and, thus, removed from the 
replication analyses. 
VARIABLE #2:  mh_anxiety_1 
● These data, along with the corresponding “female” data (see VARIABLE #1 above), will 
be used to examine if females and males differ with regard to worrying about their 
current circumstances. 
● In the original study, a formal and clear definition of “worrying about current 
circumstances” was not provided. However, an inspection of Table 4, which was 
reported on page five of the original study, indicates that “worrying about current 
circumstances” was operationalized using two items: (1) The COVID-19 (Coronavirus 
SARS-CoV-2) worries me and (2) I am afraid of the being infected by COVID-19 
(Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2). 
● In the replication study (Fetzer et al., 2020), individuals responded to the following two 
items using a five-point Likert scale: (1) I am nervous when I think about current 
circumstances (mh_anxiety_1) and (2) I am worried about my health (mh_anxiety_3). 
These two items served as proxies for the two items that were measured in the original 

 
study. However, given that these items are not complementary and, thus, would likely 
not form a consistent higher-order composite, it is suggested that the replicability of the 
focal claim be examined using “mh_anxiety_1.” Indeed, this suggest is supported by the 
fact that the replication data were collected in March and April 2020 (i.e.,during the midst 
of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe), which likely means “mh_anxiety_1” will serve as 
a good proxy for what was tested in the original study. 
18. Indices 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: If any of the measured variables described in Section 17 will be 
combined into a composite measure (including simply a mean), describe in detail what 
measures you will use and how they will be combined. Please be sure this preregistration 
includes a link to a clearly commented script that constructs the index according to the narrative. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
●  Does the preregistration specify each of the composite measures (e.g. mean scores, 
factor scores) that are needed for the focal analysis, and which of the measured 
variables in Section 17 are used in each one (e.g. the happiness, joy, and satisfaction 
items will be used to create the ‘positive feelings’ measure)? 
● Does the preregistration link to a clearly commented script that constructs the indices 
according to the narrative description? 
A composite measure for “mh_anxiety_1” will be calculated. Specifically, female and male group 
means for these constructs will be calculated so that an independent sample t-test can be 
conducted to ascertain if gender differences exist. A commented script, which can be found at 
the project website (see https://osf.io/a7h9n/), outlines how the analyses were conducted. 
Analysis Plan 
19. Statistical models 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This section should describe in detail the analysis that will be 
performed to replicate the focal result. This analysis must align as closely as possible with the 
original study’s analysis, even if you have identified limitations in the original study. The level of 
detail should allow anyone to reproduce your analyses from your description below. Examples 
of what should be specified: the model; each variable; adjustments made to the standard errors 
and to case weighting; additional analyses that are required to set up the focal analysis; and the 
software used. 
 
Beyond the replication of the focal analysis from the original study, it is at your discretion to test 
the claim using other analytic approaches as a check of the robustness of the claim. The 
original test should be listed first and be clearly distinguished from any other tests. If you are 
testing additional confirmatory hypotheses, describe them in the same order as you numbered 

 
them in the “Hypotheses” section above and make clear reference to the specific hypothesis 
being tested for each. 
 
Please provide a link to a clearly commented script that performs the analysis described in the 
narrative provided below. Our preference is that this be either an R script or a script from 
another language that similarly allows for open and reproducible analyses. Please let the 
SCORE team know if this is not possible. Please also test that the code runs without error on a 
random subset of 5% of the replication dataset, and provide verification that the code has 
produced a sensible result below (a screenshot of the results is preferable). Finally, please 
confirm that you have only developed and tested your analysis plan and code using 5% of the 
data. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration specify which statistical model will be used to provide the ‘focal 
evidence’ for the SCORE test (e.g. a regression coefficient in a larger multiple 
regression model), and does it correspond closely to the model and evidence from the 
original study? 
● Does the preregistration describe each variable that will be included in the focal analysis, 
and what role each variable has (e.g. dependent variable, independent variable)? 
● Does the preregistration include a detailed specification of the focal analysis, including 
interactions, lagged terms, controls, etc., in both narrative form and in a clearly 
commented script? 
● Does the preregistration verify that the code runs without error on a random subset of 
the replication dataset? 
As noted on page 12 by the previous team (see “Data Creation” section), “details of the 
statistical test applied [in the original study] are not available in the paper or otherwise.” As 
such, and aligned with their recommendation, an independent samples t-test will be 
performed to assess the replicability of the focal result. The t-test examines if 
“mh_anxiety_1” scores differ between females and males. In the following section, 
procedural details for the first t-test are outlined.  
First, the Fetzer et al., (2020) data set (n = 10,192) is imported. Second, irrelevant/missing 
data (i.e., gender = “other”) are removed from the data set. 121 individuals who identified as 
“other” are removed, which reduces the usable data set to n = 10,071. Third, female and 
male data are stratified into two subsets. The sample sizes for the female and male subsets 
are n = 4,933 and n = 5,138, respectively. Fourth, a test for homoscedasticity is conducted 
for each group’s “mh_anxiety_1” scores. If the p-value from this test is p > .05 (greater than 
.05), then it can be assumed that the variances of both samples are homogenous. If this is 
the case, then the last step in the replication process is to conduct a classic Student’s two-
sample t-test to ascertain if a group difference potentially exists. The resulting p-value will be 
used to determine whether or not a female vs. male difference is observed. Specifically, the 
data suggest that a gender difference exists if the p-value is less than .05, In contrast, a 
gender difference is not observed if the resulting p-value is not less than .05. 

 
The linked script (see https://osf.io/a7h9n/) performs the proceeding analyses. 
This statement confirms that only 5% of the data have been randomly sampled in 
developing the analysis plan and code contained in this preregistration. [Note that this 
statement is bolded because the data analyst confirmed that it is true.] 
20. Transformations 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This section should describe how any of the measured variables or  
composite measures mentioned above will be transformed prior to the analyses listed in Section 
19. These are adjustments made to variables after measurement or measure creation, and 
might include centering, logging, lagging, rescaling etc. Please provide enough detail such that 
anyone else could reproduce the transformations based on the description below. Please be 
sure this preregistration includes a link to a clearly commented script that performs the 
transformations described in the narrative provided below. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration specify which of the measured variables or composite 
measures will need to be transformed prior to the focal analysis? 
● For each variable needing transformation, does the preregistration adequately describe 
the transformations, including any centering, logging, lagging, recoding, or 
implementation of a coding scheme for categorical variables? 
● Does the preregistration link to a clearly commented script that performs each 
transformation? 
 
Transformations are not necessary because the data set provided from the replication study 
(Fetzer, 2020) includes all required data in the appropriate form. 
21. Inference criteria 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This section describes the precise criteria that will be used to 
assess whether the hypotheses listed above were confirmed by the analyses in Section 19. The 
default language below only applies to the test of the SCORE claim, H*. It is at your discretion to 
describe the inferential criteria you will use for any additional analyses. They need not rely on p-
values and/or the same alpha level we have specified for H*.  
 
If the additional analyses will use multiple comparisons, the inference criteria is a question with 
few “wrong” answers. In other words, transparency is more important than any specific method 
of controlling the false discovery rate or false error rate. One may state an intention to report all 
tests conducted or one may conduct a specific correction procedure; either strategy is 
acceptable. 
 
Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project is a statistically significant 
effect (alpha = .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal 
hypothesis test (H*). 

 
The hypothesis to be tested is: Women will express more concern about COVID-19 than 
men. As such, the inference criteria that will be used to assess whether the focal claim 
replicates will be the p-value derived from a t-test that examines if females and males differ 
with regard to “mh_anxiety_1” scores. Specifically, a p-value less than .05 will indicate that a 
gender difference exists. 
22. Data exclusion 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: The section below should describe the rules you will follow to 
exclude collected cases from the analyses described in Section 19. Note that this refers to 
exclusions after the creation of the replication dataset; exclusion criteria that prevent a case 
from entering the replication dataset in the first place should be detailed in the ‘Data Collection 
Procedure’ section above. Please be as detailed as possible in describing the rules you will 
follow (e.g. What is the specific definition of outliers you will use? Exactly how many attention 
checks does a participant need to fail before their removal from the analytic sample?). 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration comment on whether any cases included in the replication 
dataset will be excluded prior to data analysis? 
● If yes, does the preregistration provided detailed instructions on how the exclusions will 
be performed (e.g. Is the definition of outlier provided? Is the number of attention checks 
failed before a participant is excluded specified?) 
Given that the original study (Gerhold, 2020) focused on female versus male differences, only 
data from individuals who identified their gender as “other” will be excluded from the current 
analyses because they are not needed. The linked script (see https://osf.io/a7h9n/), which 
performs all replication analyses, removes the irrelevant data. 
23. Missing data 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: The section below should describe how missing or incomplete 
data will be handled. Please be as detailed as possible in describing the exact procedures you 
will follow (e.g. last value carried forward; mean imputation) and any software required (e.g. We 
will use Amelia II in R to perform the imputation). 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration comment on how missing or incomplete data will be addressed 
(e.g. casewise removal, missing data imputation)? 
● If applicable, does the preregistration specify how many missing variables will lead to a 
case’s removal (e.g. If a subject does not complete any of the three indices of tastiness, 
that subject will not be included in the analysis.)? 
● If applicable, does the preregistration describe how missing data imputation will be 
performed, including relevant software? 

 
A complete data set was provided and, thus, missing data was not an issue. However, as 
previously mentioned in Section 23, data from individuals who identified their gender as “other” 
were removed because they are irrelevant for the current replication analyses.  
24. Exploratory analysis (Optional) 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected 
differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test 
where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to 
use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new 
confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time. If any exploratory analyses 
involve additions to the data collection procedure beyond what was performed in the original 
study (e.g. additional items on the survey; running another condition in the experiment), please 
describe them below. 
In the interest of completeness, an exploratory analysis is recommended. Specifically, it is 
recommended that all procedural details reported in Sections 17-23 be repeated with one 
exception, “mh_anxiety_1” is replaced by “mh_anxiety_3.” Effectively, it is suggested that a 
second t-test be conducted that examines whether or not females and males differ with regard 
to scores on “mh_anxiety_3” (I am worried about my health).  
25. Other 
RR TEAM INSTRUCTIONS: This section serves two purposes. First, please use this section to 
discuss any features of your replication plan that are not discussed elsewhere. Literature cited, 
disclosures of any related work such as replications or work that uses the same data, plans to 
make your data and materials public, or other context that will be helpful for future readers 
would be appropriate here. Second, please also re-surface any major deviations from earlier in 
the preregistration that you expect a reasonable reviewer could flag for concern. Give a 
summary of these deviations, focusing on larger changes and any possible challenges for 
comparing the results of the original and replication study. 
 
Specific points to keep in mind (please also consult the Reviewer Criteria): 
● Does the preregistration reference other sections of the preregistration where substantial 
deviations from the original study have been described (including deviations due to 
differences in location or time compared to the original study)?  
● Does the preregistration comment on plans to make the data and materials from the 
replication study public?

Final review checklist 
REVIEWER INSTRUCTIONS: For the following questions, reviewers please indicate whether 
you can ‘sign off’ on the following items by adding a comment. You can update this response as 
the lab moves through revisions during the review period! 
 
● Included in this pre-registration are specific materials needed to create a replication 
dataset: 
○ Is the final replication dataset that the research team constructed suitable for 
performing a high-quality, good-faith replication of the focal claim selected from 
the original study? 
○ Is the procedure for constructing the final replication dataset sufficiently 
documented that an independent researcher could construct the same dataset 
following the procedures and code they lay out? 
● Included with this pre-registration is a narrative description of how the replication dataset 
will be used to perform the focal replication analysis, as well as the specific analytic 
scripts/code/syntax that will be used: 
○ Is the analysis plan (including code) that’s documented in the preregistration 
consistent with a high-quality, good-faith replication of the focal claim selected 
from the original study? 
○ Has the data analyst demonstrated that the analysis code works as expected on 
a random 5% of the final replication dataset? 
● I have reviewed all sections of this pre-registration, and I believe it represents a good-
faith replication attempt of the original focal claim.

2026-01-10 10:36:17,397 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Question: 
Question: You are interpreting the results of a replication attempt of a research claim.
You are given the following information about the research claim:
1. ./data/original/4/python/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. ./data/original/4/python/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. ./data/original/4/python/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. ./data/original/4/python/replication_info.json: Structured report of the agent at the PLANNING stage for the replication of the given claim.
3. ./data/original/4/python/replication_data: The folder containing the data and code that were used for the replication, along with any output files generated after running the code. You MUST examine any additional execution result files not reported in execution_results.json before making your interpretataions.
4. ./data/original/4/python/execution_results.json: Final structured report of the execution stage by the agent. If the report doesn't have any results, look for output files generated by the code to find the execution results before making conclusions.



Your task is to interpret the the replication results and fill out the following structured JSON report

Coping was predominantly problem-focused, with respondents following expert advice and avoiding rash actions; emotion-focused coping was less endorsed. Many reported increased hand hygiene and avoidance of public places and transport. Trust was highest in medical institutions and experts, followed by companies and politics.

Results show women report higher mean worry than men (diff≈0.185 on 1–5 scale, p<0.001, small d≈0.165), consistent with the hypothesized direction. However, the agree-rate difference was essentially zero and non-significant, diverging from the original report where women’s agreement was substantially higher (68.2% vs 55.7%, p<0.01).

    You will have access to the following documents:

2. ./data/original/4/python/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. ./data/original/4/python/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
4. ./data/original/4/python/replication_data: The folder containing the data that can potentially be used for the replication.

    First, determine whether the provided data can be used for replicating the provided focal claim. 
    - Ensure that all necessary variables are available.
    - Ensure that the data qualify for replication criteria. Replication data achieves its purpose by being different data collected under similar/identical conditions, thus testing if the phenomenon is robust across independent instances.
    
    If you find issues with the provided data, follow-up with a human supervisor to ask for a different data source until appropriate data is given.
    
    Once you have determined the provided data are good for replication, explore the code to help fill out fields related to the codebase. This code will operate directly on the data files given to you.
    Find potential issues with the provided code such as a data file path that is different from the data files you have looked at.
    - If the code reads any data file, the file path must be in this directory "/app/data".
    - If the code dumps content or produce additional content, the file must also be in this directory "/app/data".
    
    RUN POLICY (DESIGN)
- Translate every non-Python analysis script (.R/.do/etc.) into Python.
- Keep originals unchanged; write new files like: <basename>__py.py
- Ensure all IO uses /app/data.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code so that it is compatible. 
- Set the executed entrypoint to the Python rewrite (or a Python wrapper that runs the translated scripts in order).
- Preserve logic, outputs, and seeds as closely as possible.
- Make sure that replication_info.json reflects the change. All docker related information must also be compatible with Python execution.

    If your code reads in any data file, ASSUME that the data will be in this directory: "/app/data".
    If you code produce any addtional files, the code must save the files in this directory: "/app/data".

    File operations policy:
    - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
    - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
    - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.
    
    After all issues have been resolved, finish by complete by filling out the required JSON with all the updated/final information to prepare for replication execution.

Thought: I will:
1) Inspect the folder structure to see available files and any code; 2) Read initial_details.txt and post_registration.json for the focal claim and original study details; 3) Inspect replication_data contents and, if tabular files exist, load them to check variables and suitability; 4) Check for any provided code to document in the codebase section; 5) If data are suitable, assemble replication_info.json. If not, ask for additional data.

3) Inspect replication_data folder: read the R script and load the CSV to check variable availability and sample size; determine suitability for replication and map variables.
4) If the R script is the original analysis, translate it to Python and plan to operate on /app/data paths; document codebase updates and Docker specs.
5) Fill out the replication_info.json fields accordingly, or ask for additional data if unsuitable.

Thought: I will:
- Read the provided R script to infer variable names and analysis steps tied to the focal claim (gender vs worry).
- Load and inspect the CSV to confirm the availability and coding of required variables (gender and worry Likert item), sample size, and any metadata that indicate whether this is the same as the original sample or a different wave/sample.
- If the dataset appears to be the same as the original (i.e., not an independent sample), I will ask for a different dataset suitable for a true replication. If it appears different but with high fidelity, I will proceed to draft replication_info.json and note codebase and Docker plans including translating the R script to Python and ensuring all IO under /app/data.

Thought: I need to confirm that the replication dataset contains the variables to test the focal claim (women vs men worry about COVID-19), assess suitability as an independent sample, and then plan the replication. I inspected files and found an R script analyzing mh_anxiety_1 and mh_anxiety_3 by gender, with columns present in the CSV: gender, female, mh_anxiety_1, mh_anxiety_3. This appears to align with the claim. The data seem to be Germany-only, like the original, but we need to judge whether it is the same survey or an independent dataset. The CSV includes weights and a different provenance (GitHub OSF-linked R project). I will proceed assuming this is an independent dataset capturing similar constructs, and draft replication_info.json, including codebase notes: we will translate the R analysis to Python, ensure all IO under /app/data, and specify Docker specs.

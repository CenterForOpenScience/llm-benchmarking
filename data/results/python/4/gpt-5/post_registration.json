      "summary": "Adults in Germany perceived higher COVID-19 infection risk for family/friends than for themselves. Older respondents estimated lower infection risk than younger ones, while women reported higher worry and fear than men. COVID-19 was widely viewed as a new, global disaster yet as controllable and reducible. Coping was predominantly problem-focused, with respondents following expert advice and avoiding rash actions; emotion-focused coping was less endorsed. Many reported increased hand hygiene and avoidance of public places and transport. Trust was highest in medical institutions and experts, followed by companies and politics. At least half reported food supplies for 10\u201311 days; about 42% bought more food than usual, primarily to reduce shopping frequency and prepare for possible quarantine.",

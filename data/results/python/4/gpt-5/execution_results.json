  "execution_summary": "We built a Python 3.10-slim Docker image with pandas, numpy, scipy, and statsmodels, started a container, and executed the Python translation of the analysis directly (per instruction to avoid Rscript). Initial execution failed due to a hardcoded data path (/app/data). We patched the script to search for the CSV under /workspace (container mount) with a fallback to /app/data and to write outputs under /workspace/replication_outputs. A second run completed but returned empty gender groups; inspection revealed the 'female' column was numeric (1.0/0.0), not string-coded. We patched the script to construct a robust female_bin indicator (prefer numeric 'female' >= 0.5 as 1; fallback to gender==2) and to split groups based on this. The third run succeeded, producing t-test results on mh_anxiety_1 (female > male, p < 0.001) and a non-significant difference in agree rates. Outputs were saved to ./data/original/4/python/replication_outputs. No further deviations from the planned method were required.",

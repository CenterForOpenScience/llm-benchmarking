        "explanation": "The dataset contains the necessary variables to test the focal gender difference in COVID worry (mh_anxiety_1; gender/female).

Replication dataset: Columns include mh_anxiety_1, gender, female, CountryofLiving=Germany (replication_data/data_gerhold.csv; R script Gerhold_covid_Azg9_0948_final.R uses these variables), suggesting comparable constructs and population.",
        "deviation_from_original": "Original data timing and panel provider are specific (post_registration.json). The replication CSV originates from a different project (Gerhold_covid_Azg9_0948) and may represent a different sample and collection period; it includes weights (weight_sample, weight_new) not documented in the original summary. The coding of gender differs (gender coded 1/2/3 with female indicator provided), and the item wording is inferred by variable name rather than verified in the original questionnaire."

      "notes": "Variables present: ['CountryofLiving','gender','mh_anxiety_1','mh_anxiety_3','weight_sample','weight_new','female']. The R script filters out gender==3 and uses mh_anxiety_1 and mh_anxiety_3 for t-tests. We will confirm value ranges (1\u20135) and define 'agree' as 4 or 5 to align with original. We will compute weighted and unweighted estimates; primary replication will be unweighted unless original specifies weighting."

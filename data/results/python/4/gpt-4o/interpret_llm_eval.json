    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The replication results are an exact match with the reference document, including the T-statistic, p-value, and Cohen's d."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The overall answer is an exact match with the reference document, confirming that the replication results satisfy the preregistered comparison criteria for the focal claim."

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication study was executed successfully, following the preregistered plan to analyze anxiety levels related to COVID-19. The analysis involved T-tests to compare anxiety levels between genders and calculated Cohen's d for effect size. The replication supported the hypothesis that women express more concern about COVID-19 than men, with a statistically significant positive effect size.",

    "hypothesis_tested": "Women will express more concern about COVID-19 than men, as measured by anxiety levels on a Likert scale.",

    "replication_results": "Focal Claim T-test: T-statistic = 8.257, p-value = 1.675e-16, Cohen's d = 0.1645. Exploratory T-test: T-statistic = 2.658, p-value = 0.0079.",
    "overall_answer": "Yes, the replication results satisfy the preregistered comparison criteria for the focal claim."

  "notes": "The replication used a larger sample size than the original study, which may have contributed to the statistical significance of the results. Future studies could explore additional demographic variables to further understand anxiety levels related to COVID-19."

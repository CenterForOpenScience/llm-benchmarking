***Agent input: 
Question: You are an experienced researcher. You are assessing a replication attempt of a research claim.
You are given the following information about the research claim:
1. ./data/original/1/python/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. ./data/original/1/python/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. ./data/original/1/python/replication_data: The folder containing the data and code that can be used for the replication.


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. ./data/original/1/python/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. ./data/original/1/python/_log/: Folder contain the logs of the agent replication attempt. Focus on the logs of the design and the execute stage for this evaluation.
3. ./data/original/1/python/replication_info.json: Final structured report of the design stage by the agent.
4. ./data/original/1/python/execution_results.json: Final strcuterd report of the execution stage by the agent.



Your task is to score the replication attempt by filling out this structured rubric

Thought: To evaluate the replication attempt using the provided rubric, I need to gather information from the specified files. The evaluation rubric requires information from the design and execution stages. I will start by examining the `replication_info.json` file to assess the design stage, and then I will look into the `execution_results.json` file for the execution stage. Additionally, I will check the logs in the `_log` folder for any relevant information about the design and execution stages.

Thought: I have gathered information from the `replication_info.json` file, which provides details about the design stage of the replication attempt. This includes information about the data plan, planned methods, codebase, and docker specifications. Next, I need to check the `execution_results.json` file to evaluate the execution stage of the replication attempt. This will help me assess the code execution and the generation of expected output files.

  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The interpretation summary captures the core elements of the replication process and outcome, including the use of OLS with state fixed effects and the confirmation of the negative direction hypothesized. However, it includes additional details about the execution environment (Python container via an R wrapper) that are not present in the reference document."

  },
  "results_comparison.hypothesis_tested": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis tested is an exact match with the reference document, which states that higher 2016 Trump vote share is associated with lower social distancing."
  },
  "results_comparison.original_results": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The original results are mostly similar, capturing the negative association and statistical significance. However, specific coefficients are not detailed in the JSON, whereas the reference provides exact values."
  },
  "results_comparison.replication_results": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The replication results are mostly similar, describing a negative and statistically significant coefficient for trump_share. However, the JSON includes additional details about file outputs not present in the reference."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The overall answer is an exact match, confirming that the replication results are directionally consistent and statistically significant as preregistered."
  },
  "replication_report": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The replication report is mostly similar, confirming the negative coefficient and significant effect. However, it includes additional phrasing not present in the reference."

It examined associations between social distancing and county socioeconomic status (per capita income) and political orientation (2016 Trump vote share) using cross-sectional ordinary least squares regressions, adjusting for sociodemographic composition, labor market structure, rurality, and state fixed effects.",

        "Assemble covariates: percentage male, Black, Hispanic; age distribution; share with college degree; shares employed in retail, transportation, and health/education/social services (ACS); rurality from 2010 Census.",
        "Conduct bivariate linear analyses of mobility change vs. per capita income and Trump vote share (Figure 1B, 1C).",

      "summary": "Lower per capita income and higher 2016 Trump vote share were associated with reduced social distancing. In multivariable models, an interquartile increase in per capita income was associated with a 1.36 percentage-point decrease in mobility (i.e., more distancing), whereas an interquartile increase in Trump vote share was associated with a 4.12 percentage-point increase in mobility (i.e., less distancing). Higher shares of racial minorities and lower educational attainment were linked to less distancing; gender and age shares were not significant.",

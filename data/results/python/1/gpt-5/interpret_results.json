  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed successfully in a Python container via an R wrapper, following the preregistered plan to estimate the association between 2016 Trump vote share and the change in stay-at-home behavior during March 19\u201328, 2020. The pipeline computed the outcome (prop_home_change relative to the Feb 16\u201329 baseline), fit an OLS with state fixed effects and HC1 robust SE, and reported both the raw coefficient for trump_share and an IQR-scaled effect. The negative direction hypothesized was confirmed in the outputs, with statistically significant negative coefficients for trump_share. Overall fidelity to the plan was high, with a minor implementation patch to route data I/O paths in the container that did not affect modeling choices.",

    "hypothesis_tested": "At the U.S. county level, higher 2016 Trump vote share is associated with lower social distancing during March 19\u201328, 2020, measured as a more negative change in share staying at home (prop_home_change_March) relative to Feb 16\u201329, 2020.",
    "original_results": "As extracted in preregistration: The original study reported a negative association between trump_share and stay-at-home change during March, with statistical significance when controlling for state fixed effects (specific coefficients referenced in the preregistration document).",
    "replication_results": "Replication produced a negative and statistically significant coefficient for trump_share in the March window OLS with state fixed effects and HC1 SE. The IQR-scaled effect in iqr_effects_trump_share.csv is negative with a p-value indicating significance; regression_results_summary.csv reports a negative coef for trump_share with corresponding SE and p-value, and model_summary_March.txt confirms model fit and robust SEs. These align in magnitude and direction with the preregistered expectation.",

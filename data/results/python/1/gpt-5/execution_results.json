  "execution_summary": "Built Python 3.10 Docker image with pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and patsy. Started the container and verified the plan, which pointed to an R wrapper. Obtained approval and executed the entry. The R script delegated to the Python analysis (replicate_social_distancing__py.py). I patched the Python script to copy inputs from /workspace/replication_data to /app/data if missing, ensuring all I/O occurs via /app/data. The script loaded transportation.csv and county_variables.csv, computed prop_home_change for March vs. the reference period, fit an OLS with state fixed effects and HC1 robust SE, exported coefficients and an IQR-scaled effect for trump_share. Execution completed without errors. Outputs were written under ./data (mounted to /app/data).",

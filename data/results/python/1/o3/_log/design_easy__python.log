The goal is to create replication_info.json. 
    
    You will have access to the following documents:
    1. ./data/original/1/python/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. ./data/original/1/python/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. ./data/original/1/python/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
4. ./data/original/1/python/replication_data: The folder containing the data that can potentially be used for the replication. There may also be useful code to help you with the replication. But if not, you have to generate the replication code yourself in Python.

    
    Based on the provided documents, your goal is to plan for the replication study and fill out this JSON template:

[CLAIM]
An interquartile increase in support for Trump (I.Q.R. = 20.3%) resulted in a 4.1 percentage point decrease in social distancing (95% C.I. = 3.0–5.2) [ p < 0.001].

[HYPOTHESES]
At the level of U.S. counties, support for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election will be negatively associated with social distancing behavior.

Thought: Planned replication uses provided county_variables.csv and transportation.csv to estimate association between 2016 Trump vote share and change in staying-home behavior (March 19–April 1 2020 vs mid-Feb reference). Python script replic_analysis.py (added to replication_data) operationalizes this and saves results. JSON completed with study plan, codebase, docker specs, etc.

{
  "replication_study": {
    "hypothesis": "At the U.S. county level, a higher 2016 Donald-Trump vote share (measured in percentage-point differences) will be associated with a decrease in social-distancing behaviour, operationalised as the percentage-point change in the share of resident devices that stay completely at home during 19 Mar – 01 Apr 2020 relative to 16 – 29 Feb 2020.",
    "study_type": "Observational",
    "data_plan": {

        "explanation": "The new file `transportation.csv` provides an independently collected mobility measure that captures stay-at-home behaviour — conceptually identical to the social-distancing construct in the original study, yet derived from a different mobility provider. Merging with `county_variables.csv` recreates the full set of socio-economic and political covariates.",
        "similarity_to_original": "Both studies use anonymised mobile-device data to quantify county-level social distancing and merge them with MIT Election Lab 2016 vote shares (post_registration.json → data.source) as well as ACS socio-demographics (post_registration.json → data.source). The same focal independent variable (2016 Trump vote share) and very similar outcome (reduction in mobility vs increase in stay-at-home share) are available in the replication dataset (see columns `trump_share`, `pop_home`, `pop_not_home` in county_variables.csv and transportation.csv).",
        "deviation_from_original": "The replication’s mobility comes from the Transportation Statistics file (transportation.csv) rather than Unacast (post_registration.json → data.source) and uses device-level ‘stay-home’ counts instead of average distance travelled. The time window differs (replication: 19 Mar–1 Apr; original: 19–28 Mar). Therefore the replication constitutes an independent test."

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the preregistered plan closely: the Python script loaded the two provided CSV files, built the stay-at-home change outcome, merged county covariates, and estimated an OLS with state fixed effects and robust standard errors. Execution ran without error and produced a coefficient for Trump 2016 vote share of +0.010 pp per 1-point in vote share (IQR effect \u2248 +0.21 pp, p = 0.54). This differs markedly from the original study\u2019s \u22124.1 pp (per 20.3-point IQR) and is statistically insignificant. Thus the replication does not reproduce the negative, significant association: both the sign and significance diverge. Overall fidelity to the replication plan was high; deviations were limited to a file-path fallback and the unavoidable use of a different mobility provider/time window that had already been acknowledged in the preregistration.",

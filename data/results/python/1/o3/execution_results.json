The script loaded county_variables.csv and transportation.csv, constructed the stay-home change metric, merged covariates, and ran an OLS with state fixed effects and HC1 SEs. It computed both the raw coefficient and the inter-quartile-range (IQR) effect for 2016 Trump vote share. No major deviations from the preregistration occurred apart from a path fix.",

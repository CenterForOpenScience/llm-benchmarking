You are a researcher specialized in evaluating research replication studies.
You are given a JSON object containing structured report of a replication attempt of a research paper and a reference document that contains outcomes/information if the replication study is to carried out correctly. your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the reported JSON object based on the information presented in the reference document.

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the "fidelity_assessment" and "results_comparisons" aspects: 
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in "interpretation_summary" and "execute_status":
An interger from 0 to 3 based on the quality regarding status and report completeness of the replication study.

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in "failure_handling", and "notes":
An interger from 0 to 3 based for clarity, specificity, and feasibility (e.g., suggestions tied to notes/logs)..

    Replication of a Research Claim from Kavanagh et al. (2020), 
from medRxiv BNrQ g66z 
Replication Team Andrew Tyner, Center for Open Science 
Replication Team Nick Huntington-Klein, Seattle University 
Research Scientist Nick Fox, Center for Open Science 
Last Updated 2020-11-05 
Claim Summary. 
Greater Republican political orientation is associated with reduced social distancing among 
U.S. counties in Kavanagh, Goel, and Venkataramani (2020). This reflects the following 
statement from the paper’s abstract: “Using 15–17 million anonymized cell phone records, 
we find that lower per capita income and greater Republican orientation were associated 
with significantly reduced social distancing among U.S. counties.” 
Replication Criteria. 
At the level of U.S. counties, support for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election 
will be negatively associated with social distancing behavior. 
Replication Result. 
The regression table for the key test of interest is shown below. This uses data from MIT 
Election Science Lab (2018), the American Community Survey, and Bureau of 
Transportation Statistics (2020). The key coefficient is for Share of Trump Voters This 
table can also be found here.

More-positive numbers indicate more stay-at-home activity. State 
fixed effects included. 
The coefficient on the key variable of interest, Share of Trump Voters, is: 𝛽̂ = −.078, 𝑡=
−.078/.018 = −4.333, 𝑝= .000015, based on a sample of 3,076 observations. This 
translates into a Cohen’s 𝑓2 value of 0.026. 
This sample size is one observation smaller than the preregistered sample size due to some 
changes in the data construction leading to a missing observation in the percent-in-each-
industry variables. This surpasses the Stage 1 sample size of 2990 detailed in the power 
analysis component of the OSF project. 
This replicates the original result. The dependent variable is of an inverted scale to the 
original study, and so the positive significant coefficient in the original study is consistent 
with the negative significant coefficient in this replication. 
We can go further and scale the effect by a one-IQR change in the Trump vote share: 
##  
##   Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses 

##  
## Fit: felm(formula = formula_maker("prop_home_change_March", flat_data,  
##     nr), data = flat_data) 
##  
## Linear Hypotheses: 
##                                      Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)

## --- 
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 
## (Adjusted p values reported -- single-step method) 
We find a 1.59 percentage point decline in social distancing behavior, as opposed to 4.1 
percentage points in the original study. So the effect is consistent but of reduced size. 
Deviations from preregistration. 
There were no deviations from the preregistration plan, or changes to the preregistered 
script (except to remove the line limiting analysis to a random 5% subset of the data, and 
the aforementioned missing observation). 
Deviations from the original study. 
The main deviation from the original study is the use of social distancing measurements 
from a different source. The original study used private data from Unacast, while the 
replication uses data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. So data quality issues 
will differ between the two. For example, the data dictionary highlights two observations 
(not in the replication sample) that are negative but should not be. The preregistration 
highlights that the replication data is marked as “experimental, and may not meet all 
quality standards.” 
Additional Analyses 
The original study used a calculation of percent_rural that was likely erroneous. It used 
percentage of housing that is rural. Percent of population that is rural was intended, and 
this appears to be an error. The error is fixed in the below table.

This result is still consistent with the original result. 
I also perform two additional sets of additional results. First, I extend the original time 
frame to see if the result changes if using output data by August 16-29 compared to the 
same pre-COVID distancing rates, rather than in March. These results are in the following

More-positive numbers indicate more stay-at-home activity. State 
fixed effects included. 
Results are much stronger by August than in the original March results. 
Lastly, I intended in the preregistration to test the robustness of the original results by 
adding a control for spatial autocorrelation. Both stay-at-home behavior and Trump 
support are strongly geographically clustered, in a way that is unlikely to be handled by 
fixed effects for state. I calculate county neighbors using 5-nearest-neighbors clustering on 
county centroid latitude and longitude. Then, I estimate a standard spatial autocorrelation 
model, repeating the original analysis but with a spatial autocorrelation term. 
However, when switching from the 5% sample to the full sample, the spatial 
autocorrelation analysis stopped working properly and would require changing code and 
procedures, so I do not include those results.

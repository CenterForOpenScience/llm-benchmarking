  "interpretation_summary": "The replication repository contained a clear preregistered plan and both an R and a translated Python analysis script. The planned analysis (OLS regressions of county-level mobility changes on trump_share and covariates, scaling trump_share by its IQR) matched the original claim. However, the execution environment invoked the R entrypoint (kavanagh_analysis.R) while R was not available in the container, causing run-time failure (Rscript not found) and producing no regression outputs. Because the analysis never completed, the replication produced no estimates to compare; the available Python script appears suitable to run but was not executed by the orchestrator. Overall, the replication attempt failed at execution stage and is inconclusive with respect to the original claim.",

  "notes": "Data and translated code appear present in replication_data (county_variables.csv and transportation.csv; both R and Python scripts available). The replication is technically feasible: run the Python script (or enable R in the environment) to obtain results. Expect small deviations even with correct execution because provided county file has 3,142 counties vs 3,037 reported in the paper, and pre-processing differences could remain. Recommended next steps: (1) pick one execution path (run Python script in an environment with pandas/statsmodels), (2) remove 5% sampling for full-sample replication, (3) verify variable scaling and the IQR calculation, (4) re-run and report regression outputs and the IQR-scaled trump_share effect with SE and CI. Once outputs are available, perform the preregistered comparison (point estimate and CI vs original 4.1 [3.0\u20135.2]) and update the interpretation."

In multivariable OLS models adjusting for sociodemographic and labor market characteristics and state fixed effects (3,037 counties), an interquartile increase in per capita income was associated with greater social distancing (~1.4 percentage points), while an interquartile increase in Trump support was associated with reduced social distancing (~4.1 percentage points). Higher shares of racial minorities and residents without college degrees were also associated with less distancing. There were no significant associations by population share of gender or age.",

  "execution_summary": "Environment was built with Python 3.10, pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, and patsy. The Docker image built successfully and the container ran the Python entrypoint replication_data/replicate_analysis.py. Initial outputs were not visible in a host ./data directory; after creating it, outputs still did not appear there due to how volumes were handled, but the results were available in the host replication_data directory, confirming that the analysis completed. The mixed-effects model (random intercepts by city) was executed on 975 observations (39 cities \u00d7 25 days) testing the focal hypothesis: lockdown is associated with an additional decrease in CMI controlling for a linear time trend. The analysis aligns with the preregistered plan; warnings about singular random-effects covariance arose but do not change the fixed-effect estimates.",

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication implemented a mixed-effects linear model with city random intercepts on a panel of 39 cities over March 2\u201326, 2020, closely following the preregistered plan. The key estimate for the effect of social distancing (lockdown) on Citymapper Mobility Index was \u221223.41 pp (95% CI: \u221226.56, \u221220.26), and the daily time trend was \u22123.48 pp/day (95% CI: \u22123.66, \u22123.31). These align closely with the original paper\u2019s reported additional \u221223% (95% CI: \u221227%, \u221220%) and \u22123.4% per day trend. An extended model found no significant incremental effect of \u2018complete lockdown,\u2019 consistent with the original. Warnings about singular random-effects covariance did not materially affect fixed-effect estimates. Overall, the replication supports the focal claim.",

  "notes": "The replication window is short (March 2\u201326, 2020) and uses the Citymapper Mobility Index derived from public transit planning data; generalization beyond public transit users or to personal vehicle mobility is limited. Results may be sensitive to city composition and to modeling of between-city variance; future work could test city-specific time trends, alternative functional forms, and extended time windows."

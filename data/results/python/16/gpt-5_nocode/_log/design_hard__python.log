    You will have access to the following documents:
    1. data/original/16/0202_gpt5_nocode/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. data/original/16/0202_gpt5_nocode/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. data/original/16/0202_gpt5_nocode/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
4. data/original/16/0202_gpt5_nocode/replication_data: The folder containing the data that can potentially be used for the replication. There may also be useful code to help you with the replication. But if not, you have to generate the replication code yourself in Python.

Then I will design and write Python code to replicate using /app/data paths, saved in the replication_data folder, and finally fill out the replication_info.json plan.

A novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19 is causing a global pandemic with 
approximately 800,000 cases as of March 30, 2020. 1 In the absence of any pharmacological 
intervention, one approach to slowing the pandemic is reducing the contact rate in the population 
through social distancing. 2  Governments the world over have instituted different measures to 
increase social distancing but information on their effectiveness in reducing mobility is lacking. 
Here we analyze the mobility data from 41 cities to look at the effect of these interventions.  
 We downloaded mobility data from the Citymapper Mobility Index (CMI) from March 2, 
2020 to March 26, 2020 for our analysis. 3 Citymapper is a public transit and map service 
spanning 41 urban cities globally. It has over 20 million users and helps optimize routes for 
public transit, biking, walking and ridesharing applications; it does not support personal 
automobile navigation. The CMI is based on planned trips on the Citymapper application. 3 We 
tabulated the data on implementation of governmental social distancing measures between 
March 2 and March 26 from officia

2026-02-02 18:23:08,801 - replication - INFO - ***Agent output (Thought):
Thought: I inspected the focal claim and methods from initial_details.txt and post_registration.json, reviewed the original paper PDF for methodological specifics, and examined the replication_data folder. The provided dataset contains Citymapper Mobility Index (CMI), policy indicators (lockdown, completeLockdown), and additional Google mobility variables. I created a Python script (replication_data/replicate_analysis.py) that reads data from /app/data, constructs a day index, and fits a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression with city random intercepts to estimate the time trend and the additional effect of lockdown on CMI, saving outputs to /app/data. Below is the replication plan and environment specification.

Answer: {
  "replication_study": {
    "hypothesis": "Controlling for a linear time trend and city-specific random intercepts, the introduction of social distancing (lockdown=1) is associated with an additional decrease of approximately 23 percentage points in the Citymapper Mobility Index (CMI) relative to days without such measures.",
    "study_type": "Observational",
    "data_plan": {
      "dataset_identifier": "replicationDataset_Malik2020_with.year.csv (replication_data folder)",

      "qualification": {
        "explanation": "The dataset includes the same key constructs as the original (CMI outcome and lockdown indicators), enabling a close replication of the original multilevel mixed-effects analysis. It is sufficiently different as it covers 39 (not 41) cities, constituting a distinct sample while preserving the original study design.",
        "similarity_to_original": "Original study used CMI and policy dates for 41 cities, March 2–26, 2020, and a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression (post_registration.json; original_paper.pdf). The replication dataset contains CMI (CMI column) and policy indicators (lockdown, completeLockdown) with the same temporal window and daily granularity (dataDictionary.xlsx - Sheet1.csv; replicationDataset_Malik2020_with.year.csv).",
        "deviation_from_original": "Original sample size: 1,025 observations across 41 cities (25 per city) from March 2–26, 2020 (post_registration.json; original_paper.pdf). Replication dataset: 975 observations across 39 cities (25 per city), implying two cities fewer than the original (replicationDataset_Malik2020_with.year.csv; city unique categories=39)."

      "notes": "The dataset includes additional Google mobility variables (CMRT_*), not necessary for the focal replication. Column EXTRAS is empty. date is a string and is parsed to datetime in the code. CMI is integer percentage of baseline trips. lockdown and completeLockdown are binary indicators based on Malik et al.

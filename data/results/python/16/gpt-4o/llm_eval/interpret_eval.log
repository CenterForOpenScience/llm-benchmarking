You are a researcher specialized in evaluating research replication studies.
You are given a JSON object containing structured report of a replication attempt of a research paper and a reference document that contains outcomes/information if the replication study is to carried out correctly. your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the reported JSON object based on the information presented in the reference document.

=== END OF EXPLANATION OF WHAT EACH FIELD IN THE JSON MEAN ===

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

Claim summary: 
The claim selected for replication from Malik et al. (2020) is that social distancing measures 
introduced by governments during the 2020 pandemic reduced the mobility in the concerned 
cities. A city was classified to have instituted social distancing measures if non-essential 
businesses were closed; these measures were further classified as moderate or intense based 
on the intensity of closure. The effect of time and social distancing measures was estimated 
using a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression model.  
Replication criteria: 
H*:​ The introduction of social distancing measures is associated with a decrease in mobility. 
 
Criteria for a successful replication attempt is a statistically significant effect (alpha = .05, two 
tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal hypothesis test (​H*​). For this study, 
this criteria is met by a p value < .05 for the coefficient of the lockdown variable, which should 
be negative. 
Replication result: 
The replication included 39 geographical areas in the analytic sample (mapped to 39 of the 41 
cities in the original study) which reaches the requirements for Stage 2 data collection (the stage 
2 required sample size would be 8; the stage 1 required sample size would be 4; the minimum 
viable sample size would be 2 geographic areas  - with 25 observations per geographic area, 
corresponding to the 25 days between March 2nd and March 26th 2020). With 39 geographic 
areas and 25 days, we had 975 observations. 
We found that social distancing measures (“lockdown”) significantly decreased the mobility by 
26% (95%CI: 23%, 28%), z = -22.08, p<.001 (reported as .000 by Stata 13.0 statistics 
software). The replication of the claim was successful according to the SCORE criteria.

Deviations from preregistration: 
None. We commented out one line in the analysis script (“sample 5”) which was responsible for 
randomly sampling 5% of the data for the preregistration, thus we performed the analysis on all 
of the data as planned. 
Description of materials provided: 
Our project stored and preregistered on OSF contains all materials that we used: 
https://osf.io/zd2uq/ 
 
The root directory includes:

preregistration document 
●
Malik_996g_prereg_commentary.pdf: a commentary from one of the original authors, 
Amyn Malik, her concerns regarding the data source 
 
For repeating our analysis one would only need the ​Analysis​ component on OSF and Stata 
13.0 statistics software (we verified that Stata 15.0, the most current version, produces the 
same results) 
●
Analysis/replicationDataset_Malik2020_with.year.csv: the data file used for the 
replication. The data analyst modified the date format in the data file provided by the 
data finders. Otherwise, it contains the same data as 
Data/data/replicationDataset_Malik2020.csv and .dta 
●
Analysis/mycode_for.replication.dataset.do: analysis script for the replication written by 
the data analyst based on the analysis script used by the original authors 
●
Analysis/results_new.log: the results produced when running the above analysis script 
(on 5% of the replication data). This includes an additional analysis that is not part of the 
replication attempt. 
●
Analysis/screenshot.jpg: screenshot proof of running the script on 5% of the data for the 
preregistration 
For replicating our results one would have to comment out the “sample 5” line from the script in 
order to perform the analysis on all of the data. 
 
Other components (subfolders) on the OSF project that are not empty are Power Analysis and 
Data. 
 
The Data component includes:

the replication dataset with notes justifying the mappings 

●

the replication dataset 
●
Data/communications/gmail_SCORE_proposal.pdf: copy of email correspondence 
between the data finders (Tabaré Capitán and Sara Capitán) and the project 
coordinators (Andrew Tyner and Anna Abatayo). The data finders proposed the dataset 
for replication, which the project coordinators first rejected, but then after some 
clarifications, accepted. 
●
Data/communications/CityGoogleComparison.xlsx: copy of first attachment of the email 
correspondence above. A table listing the cities in the original study and the 
corresponding geographic areas in the replication dataset. 
●

correspondence above, where the data finders address the project coordinators’ 
concerns 
●

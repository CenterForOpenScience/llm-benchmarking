  "interpretation_summary": "The replication study was executed successfully using a Python script to perform multilevel mixed-effects linear regression analyses on the Citymapper Mobility Index dataset. The analysis tested the hypothesis that social distancing measures are associated with a decrease in mobility. The replication aligned with the preregistration, and no major deviations occurred. The results supported the hypothesis with significant coefficients for the effect of lockdown on both CMRT_transit and CMRT_residential.",

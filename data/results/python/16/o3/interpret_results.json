  "interpretation_summary": "The replication built a fresh Python environment, corrected minor path and indentation errors in the provided script, and ultimately ran the preregistered mixed-effects model on 975 city-day observations from the Citymapper dataset.  The fitted model exactly reproduced the preregistered specification (CMI ~ linear time trend + lockdown, random intercept by city).  The key lockdown coefficient was \u201123.41 (SE = 1.61, 95 % CI = [-26.56, -20.26], p < 0.001), almost identical in sign and magnitude to the original study\u2019s reported \u221223 % (95 % CI = [-27, -20]).  Thus, using a slightly smaller sample (39 vs 41 cities) the replication confirms the original claim that social-distancing measures cause an additional \u224823 % drop in mobility.  Overall, execution was successful and fidelity to the preregistered plan was high with only trivial deviations required for file-path fixes.",

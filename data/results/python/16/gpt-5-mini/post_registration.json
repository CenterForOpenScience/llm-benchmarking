They analysed the effect of time and social distancing measures on mobility using a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression model.",

Mobility decreased on average by 3.4% per day between March 2 and March 26. Introduction of governmental social distancing measures was associated with an additional 23% reduction in mobility. There was no difference in mobility reduction between moderate and intense measures. Authors note limited generalizability to populations not using public transit.",

  "execution_summary": "I generated a Dockerfile from replication_info.json, built a Docker image (replication-exec:latest), and started a container. I inspected the study plan and verified the entrypoint script replication_data/replication_script__py.py. After human approval, I executed the Python replication script. The script initially failed because it expected data at /app/data but the mounted workspace used /workspace; I modified the script to select the correct data path at runtime. I fixed subsequent syntax issues introduced while editing. After edits, the script ran successfully, producing processed_data.csv and replication_results.json in replication_data. The analysis matched the planned method: reading the CSV, creating date2, fitting MixedLM models for CMRT_transit and CMRT_residential (full data and 5% sample), and saving results. No deviations from the pre-specified analysis logic occurred beyond making file paths robust for the container environment.",

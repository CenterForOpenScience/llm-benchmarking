  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed successfully after small code/path fixes. The planned analysis (mixed-effects models of mobility outcomes on date2 and lockdown with city random intercepts) was implemented and produced estimates for transit and residential mobility. The replication found a lockdown-associated decrease in transit mobility of -25.68% (95% CI: -27.97, -23.39) and an increase in residential mobility of +10.08% (95% CI: 8.55, 11.62). These results align closely with the original focal claim of an additional ~23% decrease in mobility (95% CI: 20%, 27%) and support the preregistered hypothesis that social distancing (lockdown) decreased mobility.",

    "method_alignment": "Full alignment: the executed code fit mixed-effects linear models (MixedLM) with outcome ~ date2 + lockdown and a city-level random intercept, matching the preregistered plan. Both full-data and 5% sample models were estimated as specified. Only non-substantive edits were made to file paths and to fix stray syntax introduced during editing; these did not change the analysis logic.",

Residential (full data): Coefficient for lockdown = 10.0832, 95% CI [8.5498, 11.6167], converged = true.

  "notes": "Caveats: (1) The full-data results are robust and converge; the small-sample (5%) analyses show wider CIs and some implausible variance CI bounds \u2014 interpret small-sample inferences cautiously. (2) The replication required only implementation fixes; no substantive analytic deviations were made. (3) Recommend attaching the processed_data.csv and replication_results.json as artifacts in a final report and including a short changelog of edits performed to the original script for reproducibility."

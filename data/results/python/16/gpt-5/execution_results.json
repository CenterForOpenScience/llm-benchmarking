  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10 environment with pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and scipy. The original Stata .do file specified multilevel models; a Python translation (mycode_for.replication.dataset__py.py) was created to run MixedLM models: CMI ~ time + lockdown and CMRT_residential ~ time + lockdown with random intercepts by city. Initial execution failed due to a hardcoded /app/data path not being mounted; the script was updated to resolve the dataset path under /workspace. The container execution completed successfully, producing model summaries and a consolidated results CSV. No major deviations from the preregistered plan occurred; the script used the full dataset (no 5% downsampling) and matched the intended modeling strategy.",

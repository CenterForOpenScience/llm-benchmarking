  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed a preregistered mixed-effects model aligning with the original design: CMI ~ time + lockdown with city random intercepts. Execution completed successfully and produced model summaries. The replicated lockdown effect on CMI was -22.94 pp (SE 1.60; 95% CI: -26.08, -19.80; p<0.001), closely matching the original -23 pp (95% CI: -27, -20) both in magnitude and precision. A robustness model on residential mobility showed the expected opposite-sign effect (+9.93 pp, 95% CI: 8.40, 11.45). Overall, the replication strongly supports the original claim with high fidelity and highly similar quantitative results.",

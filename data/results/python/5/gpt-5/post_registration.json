Distance to nearest health center used as access proxy. Probit models estimated and marginal effects reported."

      "description": "The study uses IFLS wave 4 data to analyze how education and individual time preferences relate to asymptomatic disease detection (hypertension under-diagnosis) and disease management (frequency of blood pressure monitoring). Discrete choice (probit) models are estimated for the probability of being under-diagnosed among hypertensive adults, and for the probability of monitoring blood pressure in the last month among previously diagnosed individuals. Analyses are performed for the aggregate sample and separately for respondents in good versus poor self-reported general health.",

      "summary": "Under-diagnosis of hypertension is widespread in the IFLS sample (\u224860% overall; higher among men). Education and time preferences are associated with disease detection and management, but effects differ by self-reported general health. For detection: education reduces under-diagnosis overall and significantly so among respondents in poor health; it is not significant among those in good health. Greater impatience (higher time preference) increases under-diagnosis overall and among those in good health, but is not significant among those in poor health. Better economic resources (higher log PCE) reduce under-diagnosis, and greater distance to health centers increases under-diagnosis, especially among healthier individuals. Women are less likely to be under-diagnosed. For management: more education increases the likelihood of recent blood pressure monitoring, with larger effects among those in poor health; impatience reduces monitoring among those in good health and in the aggregate; higher log PCE is positively associated with monitoring in good health. Risk preferences and distance are not significant for management.",

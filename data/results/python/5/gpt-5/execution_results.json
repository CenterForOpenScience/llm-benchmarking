  "execution_summary": "We generated a Docker image (python:3.10-slim) with pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, and pyreadstat. The container initially planned to execute a Stata .do entry, but per RUN POLICY we rewrote the analysis in Python and replaced the .do with a bash wrapper that invokes the Python script. The Python script reads IFLS Wave 4 processed data, reconstructs key variables (under-diagnosis, years of schooling, poor health, age, sex, distance), filters hypertensive adults aged 45+ in poor health, and attempts Probit models. Due to extensive missingness in covariates (notably yrs_school and distance), the usable estimation sample after listwise deletion was zero in this extract. The script handled this gracefully, writing an explanatory note without crashing. No coefficients were estimated.",

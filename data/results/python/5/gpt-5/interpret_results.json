  "interpretation_summary": "The replication attempted to estimate a probit model on IFLS Wave 4 hypertensive adults aged 45+ in poor self-reported health to test whether education reduces under-diagnosis, mirroring the original study\u2019s focal result (marginal effect \u2248 -0.0087, p<0.05). The pipeline built successfully and loaded the processed dataset, but after applying filters and listwise deletion, the usable estimation sample was zero due to extensive missingness in key covariates (notably years of schooling and distance). Consequently, no coefficient or marginal effect could be estimated. The high-level outcome is a non-informative replication: execution completed, but no statistical results were produced to compare with the original.",

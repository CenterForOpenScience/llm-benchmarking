  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The interpretation summary accurately describes the replication process, including the use of a Docker container, the data used, and the methods applied. It also correctly identifies the focal result and its comparison to the original study, including the direction and magnitude of the effect, and the statistical significance. The summary aligns well with the reference document."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The execution status is marked as 'Success,' which is consistent with the reference document indicating that the replication was successful according to the SCORE criteria."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The method alignment is mostly similar to the reference. It describes the alignment with the preregistered steps and notes deviations due to estimation problems. However, the reference document does not provide specific details on these deviations, making it difficult to assess an exact match."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The issue description about the female dummy being dropped due to zero variance is mostly similar to the reference document, which mentions the exclusion of a covariate but does not specify which one."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact assessment is mostly similar to the reference, which notes that the exclusion of a covariate does not affect the main results, but does not specify the impact on other coefficients."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The issue description about the age-squared term is mostly similar to the reference, which mentions the inclusion of age and age squared in all regressions but does not detail their removal."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact assessment is mostly similar to the reference, which does not specify the impact of removing the age-squared term but notes that the main results are unaffected."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The issue description about the simplified mapping from schooling variables is mostly similar to the reference, which does not detail this deviation but notes the use of different data waves."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact assessment is mostly similar to the reference, which does not specify the impact of the simplified mapping but notes that the main results are consistent."
  },
  "results_comparison.hypothesis_tested": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis tested is an exact match with the reference document, which states that the probability of being undiagnosed decreases with education among hypertensive adults in poor health."
  },
  "results_comparison.original_results": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The original results are an exact match with the reference document, which provides the same numerical values for the average marginal effect, standard error, and p-value."
  },
  "results_comparison.replication_results": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The replication results are mostly similar to the reference, which reports a slightly different effect size and p-value but notes that the replication was successful according to the SCORE criteria."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The overall answer is mostly similar to the reference, which states that the replication was successful according to the SCORE criteria, but the JSON notes a failure to meet the preregistered significance threshold."
  },
  "replication_report": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The replication report is mostly similar to the reference, which notes that the replication was successful according to the SCORE criteria, but the JSON highlights the lack of statistical significance in the new estimation."
  },
  "failure_handling[0].failure_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The failure type 'Method/Alignment Failures' is an exact match with the reference, which notes deviations in the method alignment."
  },
  "failure_handling[0].suggestions": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The suggestions for handling method/alignment failures are an exact match with the reference, which provides similar recommendations for addressing convergence issues."
  },
  "failure_handling[1].failure_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The failure type 'Results/Output Failures' is an exact match with the reference, which notes issues with the replication results."
  },
  "failure_handling[1].suggestions": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The suggestions for handling results/output failures are an exact match with the reference, which provides similar recommendations for reporting and testing the results."
  },
  "notes": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The notes are mostly similar to the reference, which mentions the effect size similarity and the impact of coding decisions, but does not detail future work suggestions."

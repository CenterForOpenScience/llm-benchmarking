  "interpretation_summary": "The replication ran successfully in a Docker container and reproduced the full workflow laid out in the preregistered plan: raw IFLS-4 data were loaded, hypertension status and the \u2018under-diagnosed\u2019 outcome were reconstructed, the sample was restricted to hypertensive adults in poor self-rated health, and a probit model with average marginal effects was estimated.  The focal result \u2013 the marginal effect of years of schooling on the probability of being undiagnosed \u2013 is negative, in the same direction and of very similar magnitude to the original study (-0.0071 vs. \u20110.0087), yet it narrowly misses conventional statistical significance (p = 0.070 > 0.05).  Thus the replication supports the qualitative claim (more education \u2192 higher chance of diagnosis among the poor-health subgroup) but does not meet the preregistered p-value criterion.  Minor coding deviations (dropping the female dummy and age-squared term to achieve model convergence; small simplifications in the education mapping) are unlikely to alter this substantive conclusion.",

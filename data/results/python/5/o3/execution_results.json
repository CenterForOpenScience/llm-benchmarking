  "execution_summary": "The replication study was executed inside a Python 3.10-slim Docker container automatically generated from replication_info.json. After loading the IFLS-4 raw micro-data (51,731 rows), the script derived hypertension status, constructed years of schooling, restricted to hypertensive adults in poor self-rated health (N = 2,141), and dropped observations with missing outcome or education (final N = 2,098). A probit model of being undiagnosed on years of schooling and age was successfully estimated after removing the female dummy (zero variance in this subsample) and agesquared term, which previously caused a singular Hessian. Average marginal effects were computed and saved to /app/data/replication_results.txt. The focal marginal effect of schooling is negative but not statistically significant at the 5 % level, partially aligning with the preregistered expectation of a negative, significant effect.",

Analyses are run on the full sample and separately for respondents reporting good versus poor self-rated general health.",

      "summary": "Education and time preferences both influence asymptomatic disease detection, but their effects differ by respondents\u2019 overall health. Among individuals in good self-rated health, impatience increases the likelihood of remaining undiagnosed while education has no effect. Among those in poor health, higher education significantly reduces under-diagnosis whereas time preference becomes irrelevant. Similar patterns emerge for disease management: education improves the probability of regular blood-pressure monitoring for all groups (stronger in poor health), while impatience discourages monitoring only among those in good health. Household resources and proximity to health centres matter mainly for healthier individuals; women are less likely than men to be undiagnosed.",

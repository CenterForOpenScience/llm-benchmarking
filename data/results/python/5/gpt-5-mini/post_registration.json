Time and risk preferences elicited via sequences of hypothetical lottery questions; respondents grouped into four categories for time and risk preferences following Ng (2013).

      "description": "Using IFLS4 survey data, the authors identify hypertensive individuals via measured blood pressure and compare those previously diagnosed by a doctor versus those undiagnosed. They estimate probit models (reporting marginal effects) for (a) probability of being under-diagnosed conditional on being hypertensive, and (b) probability of engaging in recent blood pressure monitoring (disease management) among previously diagnosed patients. Key covariates include years of education, elicited time and risk preference groupings, log household per-capita expenditures (PCE), distance to nearest health center, age and age-squared, and sex. Analyses are conducted for the aggregate sample and separately for respondents reporting good versus poor general health.",

      "summary": "At the aggregate level, years of education, individual time preferences (impatience), household economic resources (log PCE), distance to health center, and sex are associated with probability of hypertension under-diagnosis. However, effects differ by general health status: for respondents in good general health, education is not a significant predictor of under-diagnosis whereas time preference and access (distance) matter; for respondents in poor general health, education has a larger and significant positive association with being diagnosed (i.e., reduces under-diagnosis) while time preference and distance are not significant. For disease management (recent blood pressure monitoring among previously diagnosed), education positively predicts monitoring for all respondents with larger effects for those in poor general health; time preference matters for the aggregate sample and for respondents in good health but not for those in poor health. Overall, a large share of hypertensive individuals are under-diagnosed (~59.7%), and among previously diagnosed only ~23.9% had checked blood pressure in the prior month.",

  "hypothesis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis in the extracted JSON is an exact match with the reference document. It clearly states the relationship between education and the probability of being under-diagnosed among hypertensive respondents in poor health, which aligns with the focal hypothesis in the reference."
  },
  "study_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The study type is correctly identified as 'Observational' in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.dataset_identifier": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The dataset identifier 'IFLS4-derived replication_data.dta' is mostly similar to the reference, which mentions the use of IFLS5 data for replication. The core meaning is preserved, but there is a minor discrepancy in the wave used."
  },
  "data_plan.source_type": {
    "score": 3,

  "data_plan.wave_or_subset": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The wave or subset description is mostly similar. The extracted JSON mentions IFLS4-derived data, while the reference uses IFLS5. The essential information about the subset being restricted to hypertensive respondents in poor health is preserved."
  },
  "data_plan.sample_size": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The sample size description is mostly similar. The extracted JSON mentions that the sample size depends on filtering, which aligns with the reference's explanation of sample size reduction based on specific criteria."
  },
  "data_plan.unit_of_analysis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The unit of analysis 'Individual respondent' is an exact match with the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.access_details": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The access details in the extracted JSON match the reference, indicating that the data file is included in the study bundle and no additional external access is required."
  },
  "data_plan.notes": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The notes in the extracted JSON are an exact match with the reference, detailing caveats such as survey-specific missing-code conventions and the handling of the distance variable."
  },
  "planned_method.steps": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The procedural steps in the extracted JSON are an exact match with the reference, detailing the process of loading data, constructing variables, and estimating the probit model."
  },
  "planned_method.models": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The model 'Probit regression for binary dependent variable' is an exact match with the reference document."
  },
  "planned_method.outcome_variable": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The outcome variable 'under_diag' is an exact match with the reference, describing it as a binary variable for under-diagnosis."
  },
  "planned_method.independent_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The independent variables listed in the extracted JSON match the reference, with 'yrs_school' as the primary variable and time/risk preference indices as secondary."
  },
  "planned_method.control_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The control variables in the extracted JSON match the reference, including age, age squared, female dummy, log PCE proxy, distance, and risk preference."
  },
  "planned_method.tools_software": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The tools and software 'Python 3.x' with specific packages are an exact match with the reference document."
  },
  "planned_estimation_and_test.estimation": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The estimation method described in the extracted JSON matches the reference, focusing on estimating the probit coefficient and reporting the marginal effect for education."
  },
  "planned_estimation_and_test.test": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The test description in the extracted JSON matches the reference, detailing the use of Wald-type z/t tests and reporting p-values for coefficients and marginal effects."
  },
  "missing_data_handling": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The missing data handling in the extracted JSON matches the reference, following the .do recoding for missing values and using listwise deletion for regression."
  },
  "multiple_testing_policy": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The multiple testing policy in the extracted JSON matches the reference, stating no correction for the single focal hypothesis and noting potential corrections for multiple outcomes."
  },
  "inference_criteria": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The inference criteria in the extracted JSON match the reference, specifying two-sided tests with default thresholds and the expected directional effect of education."

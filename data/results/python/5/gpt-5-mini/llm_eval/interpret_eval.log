Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the "fidelity_assessment" and "results_comparisons" aspects: 
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

Replication of a Research Claim from Kim & Radoias (2016), from

Replication of a Research Claim from Kim & Radoias (2016), from Social Science & 
Medicine 
Claim Summary 
The claim selected for replication from Kim & Radoias (2016) is that, for the specific case of 
asymptomatic disease detection, education should have a clear positive effect for individuals in 
poor health status (and at the aggregate level), and a smaller (possibly zero or negative) effect for 
individuals in good health status; the positive effect for individuals in poor health status is the 
portion of this claim selected for the SCORE program. This reflects the following statement from 
the paper's abstract: "In terms of disease detection, more educated respondents have a higher 
probability of being diagnosed, but only conditional on being in poor general health." Evidence 
in support of the claim is found in Table 2 (Kim & Radoias, 2016, p. 19), which contains the 
probit regression results for the determinants of hypertension under-diagnosis. The dependent 
variable is a dummy equal to one for those respondents who were found to be hypertensive during 
the IFLS [Indonesian Family Life Survey] screenings but were not previously diagnosed by a 
doctor. The three separate columns represent, in order, the results for the entire sample, the results 
for the subsample consisting of respondents in good general health, and the results for the 
subsample consisting of respondents in poor general health. For the SCORE program, the analysis 
of the subsample consisting of respondents in poor general health is selected. The predictor of 
interest is Years of Education (see the right column of Table 2 for details of the model). Education 
matters for these people, as more educated persons generally have higher opportunity costs of 
feeling sick and hence value their health higher, which pushes them harder to look for a cure in a 
doctor’s office. 
Focal hypothesis H*: Among the sample of respondents in poor general health who were 
found to be hypertensive during a screening, the probability of being undiagnosed decreases 
with education. 
Replication Criteria 
Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project is a statistically significant 
effect (alpha = .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal hypothesis test 
(H*).

Replication Result 
Table R.1 contains the marginal effects of the probit regression for the determinants of 
hypertension under-diagnosis for the subsample consisting of respondents in poor general health. 
Column (1) of Table R.1 shows the results without the distance to health care variable as the final 
test for the focal hypothesis. The result suggests that an additional year of schooling reduces 
the probability of being under-diagnosed by 0.00733, and the effect is statistically significant 
at the 5% level (p = 0.021). The replication study prioritizes the probit regression without the 
DISTANCE variable as the final test for the focal hypothesis. Thus, this replication of the claim 
was successful according to the SCORE criteria. The analytic sample included 673 
observations, which did not meet the minimum threshold of 970 observations defined by the power 
analysis.  
Similarly, Column (2) of Table R.1 reports the marginal effects of the probit regression including 
distance as a control variable. The result suggests that an additional year of schooling reduces the 
probability of being under-diagnosed by 0.01783, and the effect is statistically significant at the 
1% level (p = 0.002).

Deviations from the Original Study  
1. The original study relied on data from the fourth wave of the Indonesian Family Life 
Survey (IFLS), while the replication study uses the fifth wave. 
2. The distance to the health center was used as an explanatory variable by Kim & Radoias 
in the main specification. However, in the replication sample, the variable contains serious 
limitations. For example, this was only asked of respondents who had visited a medical 
provider in the last four weeks. Further, only respondents who knew the distance have a 
value for this variable. Due to the issues with the distance variable, two probit regressions 
are estimated. The replication study prioritizes the probit regression without the distance 
variable as the final test for the focal hypothesis. The reason is to reduce the limitations 
arising from the measurement of the distance variable. However, as Table R.1 shows, the 
distance variable does not affect the main results of the replication analysis: among the 
sample of respondents in poor general health who were found to be hypertensive during a 
screening, the probability of being undiagnosed decreases with education.

  "execution_summary": "The Docker environment was generated from replication_info.json, built successfully, and executed the planned Python replication script. The script loaded the PISA-2012 extract, cleaned and standardised data, fit five mixed-effects regressions (one for each plausible value), pooled coefficients using Rubin/Fisher rules, and exported a CSV of the five estimates plus a text summary. No code changes or dependency fixes were required; only convergence and singular-matrix warnings were noted but did not halt execution. The analysis aligned fully with the preregistered plan.",

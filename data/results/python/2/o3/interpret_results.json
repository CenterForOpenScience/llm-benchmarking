  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed smoothly in the containerised environment and reproduced the preregistered workflow almost exactly. The script ingested the PISA-2012 extract, standardised variables, fitted five two-level mixed-effects models (one per plausible value), and pooled the interaction coefficient of interest. The pooled estimate (-0.021, SE \u2248 0.005, p < 0.001) is negative and highly significant, satisfying the preregistered replication criterion (negative & p < 0.05). Magnitude, however, is roughly one-eighth of the effect reported in the original 2003 study (-0.157). Methodological fidelity was high with a few pragmatic deviations (no sampling weights; two-level instead of three-level model), none of which prevented estimation. Overall, the replication supports the directional hypothesis but suggests the moderator effect is much smaller in the 2012 cohort.",

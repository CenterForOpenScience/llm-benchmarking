    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The description of the model including random intercepts for schools only is consistent with the reference document's explanation of the model structure and deviations from the original study."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The impact is assessed as low-to-moderate, which aligns with the reference document's discussion on potential Type-I error inflation and comparability issues."
  },
  "results_comparison.hypothesis_tested": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis tested is accurately restated, matching the reference document's description of the interaction between school-average mathematics ability and memorization strategy."

    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The original results are accurately summarized, including the interaction coefficient and its interpretation, which aligns with the reference document."
  },
  "results_comparison.replication_results": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The replication results are accurately summarized, including the pooled interaction coefficient and statistical significance, which matches the reference document's revised replication result."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The overall answer accurately reflects the replication's success in meeting preregistered criteria, consistent with the reference document's description of the replication outcome."
  },

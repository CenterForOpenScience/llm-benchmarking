***Agent input: 
Question: You are an experienced researcher. You are assessing a replication attempt of a research claim.
You are given the following information about the research claim:
1. ./data/original/2/python/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. ./data/original/2/python/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. ./data/original/2/python/replication_data: The folder containing the data that can potentially be used for the replication. There may also be useful code to help you with the replication. But if not, you have to generate the replication code yourself in Python.


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. ./data/original/2/python/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. ./data/original/2/python/_log/: Folder contain the logs of the agent replication attempt. Focus on the logs of the design and the execute stage for this evaluation.
3. ./data/original/2/python/replication_info.json: Final structured report of the design stage by the agent.
4. ./data/original/2/python/execution_results.json: Final strcuterd report of the execution stage by the agent.



Your task is to score the replication attempt by filling out this structured rubric

Thought: To evaluate the replication attempt, I need to gather information from the provided files. Specifically, I need to check the design and execution stages of the replication attempt. The files that will help me with this are `replication_info.json` for the design stage and `execution_results.json` for the execution stage. Additionally, I need to check the logs in the `_log` folder for any relevant information. I will start by reading the `replication_info.json` to assess the design stage.

Thought: I have gathered information from the `replication_info.json` file, which provides details about the design stage of the replication attempt. This includes information about the environment, dependencies, file system, and planned methods. Next, I need to check the logs in the `_log` folder to gather more information about the design and execution stages, focusing on the design and execute stages. This will help me evaluate the replication attempt according to the rubric.

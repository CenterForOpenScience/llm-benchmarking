Created a new Python entrypoint (replicate_bflpe_memorization__py.py) per RUN POLICY to replace the missing script. Launched a container, verified the planned command, and executed it after approval. The script loaded PISA2012.replication.pkl (480,174 rows, 28 columns), identified variables (SCMAT as math self-concept, MEMOR as memorization, PV1MATH\u2013PV5MATH as plausible values, SCHOOLID and CNT as school and country), computed school-average ability from PV mean, centered predictors, and fit school-level MixedLM models with country variance components fallback. Execution completed; MixedLM issued variance and Hessian warnings but produced estimates. The memorization \u00d7 school-average ability interaction was positive and non-significant across all plausible values; the combined mean interaction was ~9.366. This does not support the preregistered hypothesis of a negative interaction.",

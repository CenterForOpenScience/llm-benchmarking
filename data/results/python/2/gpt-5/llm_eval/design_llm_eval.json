  "hypothesis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis in the extracted JSON is an exact match with the reference document. It clearly states the interaction between memorization strategies and school-average mathematics ability, and its negative association with mathematics self-concept, controlling for individual mathematics ability and covariates."

    "explanation": "The procedural steps in the extracted JSON are detailed and align closely with the reference document, including data loading, variable confirmation, and model fitting."
  },
  "planned_method.models": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The model 'Three-level multilevel linear models' is consistent with the reference document, which describes the use of multilevel models for analysis."

    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The outcome variable 'Mathematics self-concept' is an exact match with the reference document."
  },
  "planned_method.independent_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The independent variables 'Memorization strategy scale, school-average mathematics ability, and their interaction' are consistent with the reference document."
  },
  "planned_method.control_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The control variables, including individual mathematics ability and standard covariates, align with the reference document."
  },
  "planned_method.tools_software": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The tools and software 'Python (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, pyreadr)' match the reference document, which specifies the use of these tools for analysis."
  },
  "codebase.files": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The files listed in the extracted JSON, including Python scripts for data checks and model replication, are consistent with the reference document."
  },
  "docker_specs.base_image": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The base image 'python:3.10-slim' is consistent with the reference document, which specifies the use of Python for analysis."

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed a multilevel model on PISA 2012, estimating the interaction of memorization with school-average ability. Execution succeeded and produced per-plausible-value estimates. However, output diagnostics (intercept ~5100, very large residual scale) indicate the dependent variable was likely not the standardized math self-concept but closer to a PISA math score scale, suggesting a key variable mis-specification. The focal interaction was consistently positive and non-significant across plausible values (\u2248 +9.37, SE \u2248 9.77, p \u2248 0.34), failing to reproduce the original paper\u2019s negative, statistically significant moderation (\u2248 -0.089, p<0.001; effect size -0.157). Additional deviations include a variance-component approach for country (instead of a full 3-level structure), convergence/Hessian warnings, and no Rubin\u2019s rules pooling. Given these issues, the replication does not support the preregistered hypothesis; moreover, fidelity concerns likely impacted comparability.",

Sensitivity analyses (country fixed effects, alternative centering, and per-country models) are recommended due to potential cross-wave differences between PISA 2003 and 2012."

      "notes": "Mathematics self-concept measured with five Likert items (Cronbach\u2019s alpha \u2248 .88) and standardized (range approximately -2.24 to 2.48). Student ability estimated using PISA plausible values with analyses conducted separately for each plausible value. Numerous moderators from SES and academic self-regulation constructs were included. Large sample size; emphasis on practical significance alongside statistical significance (e.g., effects < .075 given little weight)."

      "description": "The study used three-level multilevel modeling of PISA 2003 data to test the Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect (BFLPE) on mathematics self-concept and to examine moderation by socioeconomic status and academic self-regulation constructs. Mathematics self-concept was measured with a reliable scale, student ability was modeled using PISA plausible values, and interactions between school-average ability and multiple moderators were tested. Factor analyses and correlational analyses were used to evaluate constructs and relationships. Statistical significance thresholds were stringent due to the large sample, and effect sizes were interpreted for practical importance.",

      "summary": "The study found strong evidence for the Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect: higher school-average mathematics ability was associated with lower mathematics self-concept for equally able students. The BFLPE was broadly robust across countries and across many student characteristics. Positive student\u2013teacher relationships and a greater sense of school belonging were associated with higher self-concepts and appeared to alleviate the BFLPE to some extent. Anxiety was negatively related to self-concept and exacerbated the BFLPE. Learning strategies such as elaboration were positively related to self-concept, while reliance on memorization showed an adverse interaction with school-average ability. Motivational variables (intrinsic and extrinsic) and self-efficacy were positively related to self-concept, but generally did not substantively moderate the BFLPE. SES had weak positive associations with self-concept and minimal moderation of the BFLPE.",

  "execution_summary": "I prepared the runtime (generated Dockerfile, built Docker image) and created a Python translation of the original R analysis as main.py. I updated replication_info.json to point to main.py. I started the container but the orchestrator failed to execute the entry: it reported 'Entry not found at runtime' for entry 'main.py', so the analysis never ran. Key steps: (1) created replication_info.json and main.py (Python translation of the R script), (2) generated Dockerfile and built image (replication:latest), (3) started container 'replication-runner', (4) attempted to run 'python main.py' via the orchestrator but it failed because the runtime could not find the entry file. Overall status: Partial success in environment preparation and code creation; failure to execute the analysis due to runtime entry resolution error. Alignment with preregistration: The target hypothesis and code translation were implemented, but execution was not completed, so no numerical replication results were obtained.",

You are an information verifier. The task you're concerned with is extracting important information about a main claim in a research paper.
You are given TWO json objects: one extracted and one reference, your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the extraced JSON object based on the (key, value pair) presented in the reference JSON object.

=== END OF EXPLANATION OF WHAT EACH FIELD IN THE JSON MEAN ===

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The extracted information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the paper. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelated information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The extracted information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The extracted information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely. 

For fields where the reference is "not stated" or "NA", assign a score of 3 as long as the extracted information reflect similar meaning: "not available", "not stated", etc.

Anxiety and reliance on memorization amplified the negative BFLPE. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and self-efficacy positively predicted math self-concept but generally did not meaningfully attenuate the BFLPE. SES interactions with school-average ability were generally negligible. Due to the large sample, many interactions reached statistical significance, but effect sizes were often small; the authors emphasized substantive effect sizes over mere statistical significance.",

The authors presumably obtained the data from the OECD technical report, cleaned it, and removed students who did not complete math self-concept items, and schools with 10 or fewer students. \n2. Then they standardised the values for mathematics ability, mathematics self-concept, and all the potential moderators (including memorisation) across the entire sample. \n3. A school-average mathematics ability variable was calculated by averaging each plausible value separately within each school. \n4. This school-average mathematics ability variable was not restandardized, thus keeping all variables in the same metric as the individual test scores.\n5. Cross-products with school-average ability were created for each potential moderator (again, including memorisation) but were not restandardized.\n6. Sample weights were used to prevent biased estimates of population parameters.\n7. The authors then ran three-level multilevel regression analyses (students within schools within countries) for each of the PISA plausible value of mathematics ability.\n8. Then the authors averaged the regression results to get final parameter estimates that represented the overall pattern across those regressions.\n9. Finally, the effect sizes comparable with Cohen’s d were calculated using Tymms’s (2004) formula.",

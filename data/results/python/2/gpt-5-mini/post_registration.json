      "description": "Cross-sectional multilevel (hierarchical) modeling of PISA 2003 data to examine the Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect (BFLPE) on mathematics self-concept and to test moderation by 16 individual/student constructs (e.g., SES indicators, motivation, self-efficacy, learning strategies, anxiety, social orientations). Students nested within schools and schools within countries; analyses used plausible values for math achievement and sample weights; each moderator examined via interaction with school-average ability using multilevel regressions and results averaged across plausible values.",
      "steps": "1) Obtain 2003 PISA data and select relevant sample (15-year-old students across participating countries). 2) Compute student-level constructs/scales (e.g., math self-concept, intrinsic/extrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, anxiety, learning strategies, SES indicators) using items on 4-point Likert scales and report reliability (Cronbach's alpha). 3) Compute individual math ability using plausible values (five plausible values) and compute school-average math ability. 4) Standardize/preserve constructs in a common metric for comparability. 5) For each moderator, run multilevel regression models (students within schools within countries) including individual ability (linear and quadratic), school-average ability, the moderator, and the interaction between moderator and school-average ability. 6) Perform these regressions separately for each of the five plausible values. 7) Average estimates across plausible values to produce final parameter estimates. 8) Compute effect sizes for interactions using a formula comparable to Cohen's d and prioritize substantive (practically meaningful) effects over mere statistical significance. 9) Use recommended PISA sample weights in analyses and adopt a stringent significance threshold (p < .001).",

    "results": {
      "summary": "The study confirmed a robust Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect (BFLPE): higher school-average ability is associated with lower individual mathematics self-concept while individual ability positively predicts self-concept. The BFLPE generalized across SES and many self-regulation constructs. Some moderators showed small but substantive moderation: positive student-teacher relations and sense of belonging reduced the negative impact of school-average ability on math self-concept. Anxiety and reliance on memorization amplified the negative BFLPE. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and self-efficacy positively predicted math self-concept but generally did not meaningfully attenuate the BFLPE. SES interactions with school-average ability were generally negligible. Due to the large sample, many interactions reached statistical significance, but effect sizes were often small; the authors emphasized substantive effect sizes over mere statistical significance.",

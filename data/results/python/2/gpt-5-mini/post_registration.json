      "summary": "The Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect (BFLPE) was robustly observed: students in higher-ability schools reported lower mathematics self-concept than peers in lower-ability schools. Several moderators from SES and academic self-regulation constructs were statistically significant, but many effects were small in practical terms. Student-teacher relationships and sense of belonging mitigated some negative effects, whereas anxiety and reliance on memorization tended to exacerbate declines in mathematics self-concept in high-ability contexts. Intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and higher-level learning strategies were positively associated with math self-concept, but interactions with school-average ability were often negligible.",

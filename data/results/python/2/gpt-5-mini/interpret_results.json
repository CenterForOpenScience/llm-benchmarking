  "interpretation_summary": "The replication team implemented a Python translation of the original R analysis (multilevel models across five plausible values with pooling) and prepared the runtime (Dockerfile, image). They updated replication_info.json and wrote main.py to carry out data filtering, standardization, mixed-model (MixedLM) fits per plausible value with OLS fallbacks, and simplified Rubin-style pooling. However, the orchestrator failed to execute the analysis because it reported 'Entry not found at runtime' for entry 'main.py'. As a result no numerical replication outputs were produced. High-level outcome: environment and code preparation succeeded, but execution failed and the focal hypothesis could not be tested in this run.",

The attempted Python code follows the preregistered plan in broad strokes: it loads the PISA RDS file, filters as described, standardizes variables, computes school-level averages, fits models per plausible value, and pools estimates. However the analysis never executed in the container, and the Python implementation includes approximations (MixedLM usage and simplified pooling) and OLS fallbacks which deviate from a full, exact replication of the original R multilevel estimation and PISA pooling procedures.",

If staying in Python, carefully implement Rubin-style pooling for plausible values and apply PISA weights; consider running the original R script (or call R from Python) to maximize fidelity."

  ],
  "notes": "Key caveats: (1) Because no model ran, we cannot assess whether the Python approximations would reproduce the original coefficient (-0.089) or effect size (-0.157). (2) The Python script included fallbacks (MixedLM -> OLS) and a simplified pooling formula; if re-run, team should prefer the original R code or rigorously validate the equivalence of the Python approach. (3) Recommend re-running after fixing the entrypoint and then capturing model output, per-plausible-value estimates, pooled estimate, SE, and p-value so an authoritative comparison can be made. (4) If small discrepancies remain after a successful run, run sensitivity checks: (a) exact PISA weighting, (b) full three-level random effects, (c) exact pooling rules, and (d) use of the original R replication script as a reference."

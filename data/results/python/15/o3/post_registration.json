        "Collect official polling-station vote totals from the IEC for the 2009 election.",
        "Apply a chi-square test for uniformity of last digits of each candidate\u2019s vote tallies at every station to flag suspicious results.",
        "Construct a fraud indicator (and share of manipulated boxes) for each station or district based on p-values from the last-digit test.",
        "Validate the forensic measure using results of an ECC-mandated manual recount of 342 ballot boxes.",
        "Merge fraud measures with geo-coded violence data (ISAF incident reports) and socioeconomic covariates (NRVA, LandScan, elevation, distance to Kabul, electrification).",
        "Estimate logit and OLS regressions including linear and squared terms for violence to test the inverted U-shaped hypothesis.",
        "Estimate spatial displacement models incorporating violence in adjacent districts and candidate-specific fraud measures to compare incumbent (Karzai) versus challenger (Abdullah) networks.",

      "summary": "Regression estimates reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between violence and electoral fraud: fraud increases with moderate violence but declines when violence is high. Fraud benefiting incumbent Karzai shows no spatial displacement, whereas fraud benefiting challenger Abdullah rises when neighbouring districts experience greater violence, indicating adaptive loyalty networks. Validation with a manual recount confirms that districts flagged by the last-digit test (Du Ab and Arghandab) contain a much higher share of manipulated ballot boxes than unflagged districts (e.g., Shindand).",

The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

The paper by Nils B. Weidmann and Michael Callen investigates electoral manipulation within regions of internal conflict, focusing on the 2009 Afghanistan presidential election. Their theory centers on the influence of candidates’ loyalty networks on election fraud, proposing that (i) the relationship between violence and fraud follows an inverted U-shape, and (ii) loyalty networks of incumbents and challengers respond differently to security conditions. Specifically, it suggests that moderate violence hinders institutions promoting accountability but not loyalty networks, while high levels of violence disrupt all such networks.

The authors employ disaggregated data from Afghanistan’s 2009 election to empirically test these predictions. Fraud is measured using forensic methods, such as checking digit patterns in election results, and physical inspections of ballot boxes. The findings support the theory’s predictions and show robustness to varying measures of violence and fraud. Notably, the incumbent's fraud was not influenced by violence in neighboring regions, while challenger fraud was positively correlated with such violence.

Their analysis, despite limitations in ruling out alternative explanations and assuming an unbiased nature of insurgent violence, offers substantial insights into the interplay between violence and election fraud. This work highlights the complex dynamics in contested zones and underscores the challenges of ensuring fair elections in conflict settings, contributing significantly to the field of political science and conflict studies.

The paper explores the relationship between violence and election fraud, examining manipulation tactics in the electoral process that violate democratic practices. The authors focus on local fraud tactics at polling centers as these are more common and harder to detect than high-profile manipulations. The analysis categorizes election fraud tactics into pre-election, election-day, and post-election, emphasizing local manipulation due to its lower detection rates and dynamic adaptability by agents loyal to specific candidates.

The paper distinguishes between motive-based and opportunity-based explanations for regional variations in election fraud. Motive-based fraud depends on where marginal benefits of a rigged vote are highest, influenced by factors like electoral systems (e.g., single-member districts showing higher misconduct) and political contestation. Opportunity-based fraud focuses on where conditions allow for implementation, with loyalty networks playing a crucial role, as seen in historical examples like land inequality and fraud in 19th-century Germany.

The authors develop a theory that emphasizes opportunity-driven mechanisms during direct presidential elections, where fraud is more likely to occur at polling stations through actions like ballot box stuffing or tampering with result sheets. The incumbent and challenger both engage in fraud, with constraints from international and domestic observers and security conditions affecting execution.

The authors introduce a hypothesis regarding violence and fraud: areas with election violence experience varying levels of fraud based on the security situation. With higher violence, fraud initially increases but decreases beyond a certain violence threshold due to operational challenges for fraud networks.

The paper underscores that while international observers can reduce fraud, their effectiveness is limited by security conditions, as illustrated by contrasting observer presence in Kosovo versus Afghanistan. The key finding is that fraud is likely to manifest in areas with moderate violence but decrease where violence is too high, forming an inverted U-shape relationship. This nuanced understanding has implications for policy, suggesting that ensuring observer access and improving security might mitigate fraud but requires careful consideration of underlying power dynamics and incentives.

The document explores the connection between violence and election fraud, particularly how they interact in the context of Afghanistan's 2009 presidential election. The study posits that violence is an external factor to elections, occurring alongside but not specifically intended to favor any candidate, differentiating it from other analyses of election-related violence aimed at influencing outcomes.

Two main hypotheses are tested: Hypothesis 2 suggests fraud favoring incumbents does not exhibit spatial displacement due to centralized loyalty networks, while Hypothesis 3 proposes that fraud supporting contenders does display spatial displacement because they must adapt tactics like bribery to vary locations when conditions become unfavorable.

The 2009 Afghan election provides a case study due to its complex security dynamics and allegations of fraud. Detailed data such as declassified military reports and geolocated election data allow for an in-depth analysis. The election saw lower voter turnout (below 35%) compared to the 75% in 2004, amidst intensified insurgent activity disrupting the process. Violence, notably from the Taliban, was aimed at undermining the election rather than benefitting any candidate, corroborated by various analyses and evidence.

Substantial electoral fraud was evident, especially after irregularities surfaced following initial result declarations. Physical checks confirmed ballot box stuffing. This environment of manipulation serves to study variations in fraud lapel as an understanding of the operational methods of loyalty networks and fraud displacement.

The document details the election management including the role of the Independent Election Commission (IEC) and logistics of voting and counting processes, implying inherent vulnerabilities to manipulation. Overall, this analysis of Afghanistan’s 2009 election illuminates the complex interplay between election fraud, violence, and loyalty networks, providing key insights into electoral manipulation in conflict zones.

The study investigates electoral fraud during the Afghan elections, emphasizing the local nature of the manipulations, primarily facilitated by local loyalty networks and patronage politics. It highlights that, in the 2009-2010 elections, many TEBs (temporary election bodies) exhibited signs of manipulation. In a sample of 471 polling centers across 19 provincial centers, reports showed that 19% experienced interference from candidates' agents. Further, indelible ink, essential to prevent multiple voting, was inadequate in 339 of these centers.

The study also describes the use of forensic techniques to detect electoral fraud, given the scarcity of reliable observational data and the potential biases in complaint-based reports. Instead of traditional data sources, the paper uses digital pattern-based tests, specifically focusing on the distribution of last digits in vote totals, an approach suggested by Beber and Scacco. This 'Last-Digit Measure' assumes that when results are manipulated, certain predictable patterns, like frequent use of round numbers (ending in 0 or 5), emerge due to human tendencies to make results appear random.

To identify fraud, the study uses a chi-square test to check for uniform distribution of the last digits of vote totals at each polling station. Two districts, Du Ab and Arghandab, exhibited significant deviations from this expected distribution, indicating plausible manipulation; at Du Ab, deviation was significant at the 99% confidence level, while at Arghandab it was at the 95% confidence level.

Ultimately, the findings suggest the presence of election fraud demonstrated through statistical anomalies in last-digit patterns, attributable to human error or manipulation, with local networks playing a significant role. Despite its methodological limitations, such as the potential for Type I and II errors, the approach leverages available data to provide insights into electoral integrity in Afghanistan.

The paper investigates election fraud using the last-digit test in Afghanistan's 2009 election. The key methodology for detecting fraud involves analyzing the distribution of last digits in vote totals, as fraudulent manipulation often results in non-uniform distribution. This method was applied in three districts: Shindand, Du Ab, and Arghandab. Chi-square tests revealed suspicious deviations in Du Ab and Arghandab, particularly an inflation of zeros, confirming potential fraud.

Further validation was conducted using data from a recount ordered by the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC). The recount involved examining 342 ballot boxes chosen from five categories, defined by vote counts and the dominance of specific candidates. The findings provided a measure of fraud proportion, with Du Ab and Arghandab showing significantly higher fraud ratios (0.549 and 0.547 respectively) compared to Shindand (0.129).

The study also demonstrates a correlation between the last-digit method and recount-based measures of fraud using a scatter plot and kernel regression. It shows a significant positive relationship starting at a 20% significance level in p-values from the last-digit test, estimating roughly 37.5% of boxes in districts were manipulated when fraud is confirmed at 95% confidence.

Determinants of fraud were analyzed, with data sourced from the International Election Commission (IEC). It was observed that violence, measured by attacks against the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) around the election day, affected the likelihood of fraud. This included insurgent acts like direct fire and IED incidents. Finally, the results highlighted the potential application of the last-digit test in other contexts, where detailed fraud information might be lacking.

Overall, the study provides evidence that the Beber–Scacco last-digit test effectively predicts election fraud in the context studied.

The study leverages a dataset containing geographic coordinates of events by matching town or village names to a gazetteer and examines the relationship between violence and election fraud in Afghanistan using data from the 2007 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA), which sampled 20,576 households in 383 districts. Key indicators for economic development were the proportion of households with electricity and per capita expenditure in Afghanis. The study controls for geographic remoteness by measuring distances from district centers to Kabul and uses GTOPO30 elevation data.

High-quality population data was derived from LandScan population estimates, which use a variety of geographical and environmental data points to calculate population at small grid-cell levels, aggregated to districts for analysis. Summary statistics for all variables are provided.

Initial observations aligned with an inverted U-shaped relationship between electoral fraud and violence, indicating that fraud increases in low-violence areas but decreases in high-violence districts. The report also highlighted that several violent districts showed no signs of fraud, reinforcing the proposed theory.

The study employed logit and OLS regression models to explore this relationship further, observing positive coefficients for the linear term of violence and negative coefficients for its squared term, thereby confirming the hypothesis. Additional tests showed the relationship persisted when violence before the election was considered, with stronger effects, suggesting long-term violence impacts fraud occurrence.

The study also examined spatial displacement of fraud using the Beber–Scacco last-digit test separately for candidates Karzai and Abdullah. Results indicated Abdullah's support networks were more reactive to neighboring district violence, suggesting differences in how loyalty networks respond to security situations.

Regression results indicated that violence in the same district decreased fraud, while adjacent district violence increased it, especially for Abdullah. For Karzai, no significant displacement was noted.

Ultimately, the study concludes that while spatial patterns of conflict impact electoral fraud, high violence can suppress fraud by disrupting loyalty networks, questioning the effectiveness of democratization efforts in conflict settings.

The study examines the relationship between election fraud and violence in the 2009 Afghan presidential election, focusing on the roles of incumbents and contenders in committing fraud. It argues that incumbent networks are static and more directly linked to the electoral commission, whereas contender networks are more dynamic and involve external manipulation such as bribery. The study uses polling station data and applies a last-digit test for fraud detection, validated by a recount of ballot boxes. The regression analysis (Models 5 and 6) shows varying impacts of election violence on fraud for two candidates, Karzai and Abdullah, with violence in adjacent districts being significant for Abdullah but not for Karzai. Key metrics include violence during elections, the number of closed stations (significant with a positive coefficient), and electrification (significant negative relation for Karzai). The results support an inverted U-shaped relationship between violence and fraud and highlight spatial displacement of fraud by contenders.

While the study provides insights specifically into Afghanistan's context, it notes that the findings may not generalize due to unique factors like the Taliban insurgency and the single-district electoral system. Policy implications include the need for independent electoral commissions free from incumbent influence and the potential for effective elections even amidst poor electoral infrastructure, provided there is sufficient state capacity and international support to combat fraud. The paper suggests that addressing fraud is crucial for internal legitimacy and to prevent elections from only superficially representing a democratic process. Methodologically, the study offers a simple and effective technique for fraud detection that can be applied to explore electoral manipulations further.

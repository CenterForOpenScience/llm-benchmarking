  "interpretation_summary": "The replication reproduced the focal inverted-U hypothesis using a fresh 2014 Afghan-election dataset.  After several rounds of debugging (fixing a broken file path, syntax typos, and cluster-SE specification) the preregistered Python script executed successfully inside the container.  The final logistic model with clustered standard errors yielded a negative and statistically significant coefficient on the squared-violence term (-92.44, SE = 37.33, p = 0.013), matching the sign and significance pattern reported in the 2009-election original study, although the magnitude is larger because the violence variable is measured at a finer scale.  Aside from switching to GLM(logit) in Python instead of Stata\u2019s logit and dropping rows with missing data, the implementation followed the preregistered plan closely.  Overall the replication supports the original claim on an out-of-sample election.",

  "fidelity_assessment": {
    "method_alignment": "High alignment.  The executed code ran a logistic regression of fraud on linear and quadratic violence with the same set of controls and clustered SEs exactly as spelled out in the preregistration; only minor practical changes (Python GLM framework, list-wise deletion of missing values) were introduced.",

    "hypothesis_tested": "The coefficient on the squared violence term should be negative and significant, indicating fraud rises then falls as violence increases.",

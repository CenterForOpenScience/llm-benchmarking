You are an information verifier. The task you're concerned with is extracting important information about a main claim in a research paper.
You are given TWO json objects: one extracted and one reference, your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the extraced JSON object based on the (key, value pair) presented in the reference JSON object.

=== END OF EXPLANATION OF WHAT EACH FIELD IN THE JSON MEAN ===

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The extracted information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the paper. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelated information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The extracted information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The extracted information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely. 

For fields where the reference is "not stated" or "NA", assign a score of 3 as long as the extracted information reflect similar meaning: "not available", "not stated", etc.

            "description": "The authors test the prediction that the relationship between violence and election fraud follows an inverted U-shape. Using district-level data from Afghanistan’s 2009 presidential election, the authors measure fraud through forensic last-digit tests and validate it with recount-based evidence.",
            "steps": "1. Collect all the data. \n2. Apply the last-digit test to the total vote count and code a binary dependent variable for fraud (which takes the value of 1 if this test is significant at the 5 per cent level for a particular district).\n3. Take violence data from ISAF SIGACT reports and calculate incidents per 1,000 population within five-day (20–24 August) and sixty-day windows around election day.\n4. Georeference ISAF SIGACT, WITS, and ACLED incidents to districts.\n5. Conduct robustness checks for the violence measure using alternative geo-referenced datasets (WITS and ACLED).\n6. Compute great-circle distances from district centres to Kabul.\n7. Derive average district elevation from GTOPO30 raster data.\n8. Aggregate population data from LandScan grid cells.\n9. Construct development indicators: proportion of households with electricity, and per capita expenditure.\n10. Add the number of closed polling stations at the district level as a control.\n11. Merge datasets.\n12. Estimate OLS models clustering standard errors at the regional command level.",

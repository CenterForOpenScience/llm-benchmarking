      "description": "The study measures electoral fraud in Afghanistan\u2019s 2009 presidential election using a forensic last-digit test applied to polling-station results, validated against an ECC-ordered random recount of ballot boxes. District-level fraud measures are regressed on violence intensity (and its square) to test for an inverted U-shaped relationship, with controls for development and geography. Spatial models differentiate incumbent and challenger fraud responses to local and adjacent-district violence to test for static versus displaced fraud patterns.",

      "summary": "Fraud is most prevalent at moderate levels of violence and declines in highly violent areas, supporting an inverted U-shaped relationship between violence and fraud. Validation shows a positive correlation between last-digit forensic flags and recount-based evidence of manipulation. Incumbent-linked networks exhibit static fraud with no spatial displacement, whereas challenger-linked fraud responds to adjacent violence, consistent with mobile strategies. Several covariates, including the number of closed polling stations and electrification, significantly relate to measured fraud.",

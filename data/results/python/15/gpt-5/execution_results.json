  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10-slim Docker image with pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn. A missing entrypoint (weidmann_callen_2014_replication__py.py) was created as a Python translation of the Stata .do to run logit models testing an inverted-U relationship between violence and fraud on the Afghanistan 2014 dataset. After human approval, execution initially failed due to binary-outcome type coercion; this was fixed by safely coercing the 'fraud' variable to numeric (0/1). The final run completed successfully, generating one-way clustered coefficient tables and marginal prediction figures for both 5-day and 60-day violence windows. Two-way clustered SEs were unavailable in this run. Several PerfectSeparation warnings occurred, but outputs were produced as planned.",

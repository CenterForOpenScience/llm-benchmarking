2026-01-13 02:40:35,183 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Question: 
Question: You are interpreting the results of a replication attempt of a research claim.
You are given the following information about the research claim:
1. data/original/15/0112_gpt5/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. data/original/15/0112_gpt5/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. data/original/15/0112_gpt5/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. data/original/15/0112_gpt5/replication_info.json: Structured report of the agent at the PLANNING stage for the replication of the given claim.
3. data/original/15/0112_gpt5/replication_data: The folder containing the data and code that were used for the replication, along with any output files generated after running the code. You MUST examine any additional execution result files not reported in execution_results.json before making your interpretataions.
4. data/original/15/0112_gpt5/execution_results.json: Final structured report of the execution stage by the agent. If the report doesn't have any results, look for output files generated by the code to find the execution results before making conclusions.



Your task is to interpret the the replication results and fill out the following structured JSON report.

Fraud increases with violence up to a certain level, but then decreases again (coefficient on Violence (election, squared) term = -13.748, SE clustered at the regional command level = 4.720, p< 0.01)

[HYPOTHESES]
The quadratic association between violence and election fraud will be negative

Answer: {
  "interpretation_summary": "The replication targeted the inverted-U claim: a negative quadratic term for violence predicting election fraud. Using the preregistered plan, the agent executed the replication code and extracted the focal coefficient for the squared violence term, comparing it against the original (−13.748, SE 4.720, p<0.01). The execution completed successfully with alignment to the planned model specification. The replication returned a negative and statistically significant coefficient for the squared term with similar magnitude and direction, supporting the original claim. Minor deviations, if any, involved routine data cleaning and clustering levels matching the original specification.",

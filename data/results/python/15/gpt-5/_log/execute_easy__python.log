2026-01-13 02:23:45,253 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

**Phases of Execution:**

PHASE 1: BUILD ENVIRONMENT
1. `orchestrator_generate_dockerfile`: Creates _runtime/Dockerfile from replication_info.json.
2. `orchestrator_build_image`: Builds the image.
   * IF BUILD FAILS: Read the error log. It usually means a missing system package or R/Python library. Edit `replication_info.json` to add the missing dependency, regenerate the Dockerfile, and rebuild.

PHASE 2: PREPARE RUNTIME
3. `orchestrator_run_container`: Mounts the code and data and starts the container.
4. `orchestrator_plan` & `orchestrator_preview_entry`: Verify what will run.

PHASE 3: HUMAN APPROVAL (Strict Check)
5. Before running the actual analysis code, you MUST Ask the human:
   Action: ask_human_input: "Ready to execute command: <COMMAND>. Approve? (yes/no)"
   * If they say "no", stop the container and fill the output JSON with status "cancelled".
   * If they say "yes", proceed to Phase 4.

PHASE 4: EXECUTE & DEBUG
6. `orchestrator_execute_entry`: Runs the code.
   * IF EXECUTION FAILS (exit_code != 0): 
     - Read the `stderr` in the observation.
     - Identify if it is a code error or missing library.
     - Use `write_file` to fix the script or `replication_info.json`.
     - If you changed dependencies, you must go back to Phase 1 (Rebuild).
     - If you only changed code, you can retry `orchestrator_execute_entry`.

PHASE 5: FINALIZE
7. `orchestrator_stop_container`: Cleanup.
8. Parse `execution_result.json` and output the Answer in the following required JSON schema.

Thought: The run failed because ensure_binary attempted a string-to-int comparison during thresholding. I will:
- Add a new helper ensure_binary_safe that coerces to numeric via pd.to_numeric and then thresholds.
- Replace the call site to use ensure_binary_safe instead of the original ensure_binary.
Then I will re-run the analysis.

Thought: I followed the required phases: generated the Dockerfile, built the image, started a container, inspected the plan, created a missing Python entrypoint by translating the .do logic, obtained human approval, executed the analysis, debugged a type error by patching the outcome coercion, and re-ran successfully. Outputs were saved into /app/data inside the container. Two-way clustered standard errors were unavailable in this run; one-way cluster tables and margins were produced. There were PerfectSeparation warnings from statsmodels, but the run completed and saved outputs.

  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10-slim Docker image with pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn. A missing entrypoint (weidmann_callen_2014_replication__py.py) was created as a Python translation of the Stata .do to run logit models testing an inverted-U relationship between violence and fraud on the Afghanistan 2014 dataset. After human approval, execution initially failed due to binary-outcome type coercion; this was fixed by safely coercing the 'fraud' variable to numeric (0/1). The final run completed successfully, generating one-way clustered coefficient tables and marginal prediction figures for both 5-day and 60-day violence windows. Two-way clustered SEs were unavailable in this run. Several PerfectSeparation warnings occurred, but outputs were produced as planned.",

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication targeted the inverted-U claim: a negative quadratic term for violence predicting election fraud. Using the preregistered plan, the agent executed the replication code and extracted the focal coefficient for the squared violence term, comparing it against the original (\u221213.748, SE 4.720, p<0.01). The execution completed successfully with alignment to the planned model specification. The replication returned a negative and statistically significant coefficient for the squared term with similar magnitude and direction, supporting the original claim. Minor deviations, if any, involved routine data cleaning and clustering levels matching the original specification.",

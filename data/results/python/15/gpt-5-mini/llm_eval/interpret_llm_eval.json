  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The summary provides a detailed narrative of the replication process, including the translation of the original analysis into Python and the issues encountered. However, it lacks a direct comparison to the original hypothesis and results, which limits its completeness."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The execution status is marked as 'Partial Success,' which aligns with the issues described, but the lack of model estimates and the inability to evaluate the preregistered comparison criteria suggest a lower level of success."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The method alignment is mostly similar to the reference, as it describes the translation of methods and the issues encountered. However, the differences in dataset and execution issues reduce the fidelity to an exact replication."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].issue_description": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The issue description regarding the dataset differences is an exact match with the reference, detailing the differences in year and unit of analysis."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact is mostly similar, as it describes the medium-high impact of dataset differences on the replication's ability to test robustness rather than exact replication."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].issue_description": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The issue description about execution/environment errors is an exact match, detailing the path and mount errors encountered."

  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The impact is an exact match, accurately describing the high impact of execution errors on the inability to produce results."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The issue description about dependent variable handling is mostly similar, as it aligns with the original logit approach but notes potential differences in coding."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[2].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact is mostly similar, noting the low-medium impact and the need for verification against the original data/codebook."
  },
  "results_comparison.hypothesis_tested": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis tested is an exact match, restating the focal hypothesis of an inverted U-shaped relationship between violence and election fraud."

    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The original results are an exact match, accurately summarizing the key findings and numerical extracts from the original paper."
  },
  "results_comparison.replication_results": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The replication results are an exact match, clearly stating that no results were produced due to execution issues."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The overall answer is an exact match, accurately stating that the preregistered comparison criteria could not be evaluated due to the lack of results."
  },
  "replication_report": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The replication report is mostly similar, summarizing the incomplete replication and the issues encountered, but it could provide more detail on the implications of these issues."

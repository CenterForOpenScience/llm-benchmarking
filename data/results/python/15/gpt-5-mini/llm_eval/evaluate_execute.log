***Agent input: 
Question: You are an experienced researcher. You are assessing a replication attempt of a research claim.
You are given the following information about the research claim:
1. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data: The folder containing the data that can potentially be used for the replication. There may also be useful code to help you with the replication. But if not, you have to generate the replication code yourself in Python.


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/_log/: Folder contain the logs of the agent replication attempt. Focus on the logs of the design and the execute stage for this evaluation.
3. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_info.json: Final structured report of the design stage by the agent.
4. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/execution_results.json: Final strcuterd report of the execution stage by the agent.



Your task is to score the replication attempt by filling out this structured rubric

Thought: To evaluate the replication attempt, I need to gather information from the provided files, particularly focusing on the design and execution stages. I will start by examining the `replication_info.json` to assess the design stage, which includes checking the environment, dependencies, and file system. Then, I will review the `execution_results.json` to evaluate the execution stage, focusing on code execution and the execution report. 

First, I will read the `replication_info.json` to gather information about the design stage.

The Python script was executed once and initially failed because it could not find the CSV at the absolute path used. I updated the script to locate the CSV robustly (relative to the script location and fallback mount points). A subsequent attempt to execute the entry failed when the orchestrator reported replication_info.json not found on the host path (an orchestrator-level error), preventing the container from being started or the entry from being run successfully. No final model outputs (model summaries, coefficient CSVs, margins CSVs, or execution_result.json) were produced in the container's replication_data directory because the final execution step did not complete. The process followed the preregistered plan (translation of the .do to Python, logit with quadratic terms and clustering), but the run was interrupted by environment/file-access issues before model estimates could be obtained.",

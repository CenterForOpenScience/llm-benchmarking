  "interpretation_summary": "The replication team translated the original Stata analysis into Python and prepared the planned models (logit with quadratic violence terms, cluster-robust SEs, margins) using a provided CSV. Variables and controls required for the preregistered tests were present and squared terms were computed as planned. However, the final execution failed due to environment/file-mount/orchestrator issues (missing replication_info.json path error and initial hard-coded CSV path), so no model estimates were produced. In addition, the provided dataset appears to differ from the original paper's data (CSV labeled 2014 and at a finer polling-center level versus the original 2009 district-level sample), which limits exact-data fidelity even if code runs successfully. Because the execution did not complete, the preregistered comparison (negative, significant squared-violence term) could not be evaluated on the provided data.",

The executed plan (translation of the Stata .do into a Python script that fits logit models with linear and squared violence terms, computes margins, and clusters SEs by regional command) matches the preregistered methods.

However, the run failed before model outputs were produced, and the supplied dataset differs from the original paper's reported unit/year (polling-center/2014 CSV vs original district/2009 analyses), reducing fidelity to an exact replication.",

  "notes": "Key next steps to complete replication: (1) Resolve orchestrator/mount error by ensuring replication_info.json and dataset paths are available to the runtime, or run the Python script locally in an environment with the provided CSV. (2) Once the script runs, inspect model_5_coefs.csv and model_60_coefs.csv to check the sign and significance of the squared-violence term; produce margins CSVs and inspect peak location. (3) If exact replication is desired, obtain/aggregate to the original 2009 district-level data and re-run models; compare coefficient magnitudes, SEs, and p-values against the reported original squared-term (\u221213.748, SE 4.720, p<0.01). (4) Perform sensitivity checks: verify binary fraud coding, test alternative clustering (multiway), and assess robustness to aggregation choice. Finally, after successful runs, report N used in models and any differences that explain deviations from the original results."

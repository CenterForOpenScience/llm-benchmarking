The Python script was executed once and initially failed because it could not find the CSV at the absolute path used. I updated the script to locate the CSV robustly (relative to the script location and fallback mount points). A subsequent attempt to execute the entry failed when the orchestrator reported replication_info.json not found on the host path (an orchestrator-level error), preventing the container from being started or the entry from being run successfully. No final model outputs (model summaries, coefficient CSVs, margins CSVs, or execution_result.json) were produced in the container's replication_data directory because the final execution step did not complete. The process followed the preregistered plan (translation of the .do to Python, logit with quadratic terms and clustering), but the run was interrupted by environment/file-access issues before model estimates could be obtained.",

  "diagnosis_and_next_steps": "Root cause: final execution was blocked by file/mount/orchestrator-level issues. Specifically: (1) The Python script initially attempted to read the CSV from a hard-coded absolute path that did not resolve inside the container; I updated the script to find the CSV relative to the script directory and fallback mount points. (2) Later orchestrator attempts to run/stop the container failed with an error 'replication_info.json not found at: <host-path>'. This appears to be an orchestrator-host path access or mount detection problem (the same file existed earlier when the Dockerfile was generated). Recommended next steps to complete the replication run: \n- Confirm replication_info.json is present and accessible at the exact host path expected by the orchestrator and that file permissions allow read access. Re-add the file or fix path if needed. \n- Re-start the container (or re-run orchestrator_run_container) after ensuring replication_info.json is accessible. \n- Re-run orchestrator_execute_entry to run python replication_data/Weidmann_Data_Analysis_Final__py.py inside the container. The Python script has been adjusted to find the CSV robustly and should run once the container is started with proper mounts. \n- If the orchestrator continues to fail on host-file detection, alternatively run the Python script manually inside the container (shell) using a container-level run command (requires human approval) or use run_shell_command to execute python /workspace/replication_data/Weidmann_Data_Analysis_Final__py.py. \n- After successful run, inspect outputs: model_5_coefs.csv, model_60_coefs.csv, margins_sigact_5r.csv, margins_sigact_60r.csv, dataset_info.json, execution_result.json. Compare linear and squared terms to preregistered criterion (squared term negative and p < 0.05).",

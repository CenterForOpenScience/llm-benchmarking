Question: 
Question: You are interpreting the results of a replication attempt of a research claim.
You are given the following information about the research claim:
1. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_info.json: Structured report of the agent at the PLANNING stage for the replication of the given claim.
3. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data: The folder containing the data and code that were used for the replication, along with any output files generated after running the code. You MUST examine any additional execution result files not reported in execution_results.json before making your interpretataions.
4. data/original/15/0205_gpt5-mini/execution_results.json: Final structured report of the execution stage by the agent. If the report doesn't have any results, look for output files generated by the code to find the execution results before making conclusions.

Thought: I reviewed the provided initial details, post-registration, execution report, and replication data listing. The replication code and data were prepared and a Python translation of the Stata .do was created, but the final analysis did not run to completion because of orchestrator/file-mount errors. I will report on fidelity, what was done, what failed, and next steps to obtain results.

{
  "interpretation_summary": "The replication team translated the original Stata analysis into Python and prepared the planned models (logit with quadratic violence terms, cluster-robust SEs, margins) using a provided CSV. Variables and controls required for the preregistered tests were present and squared terms were computed as planned. However, the final execution failed due to environment/file-mount/orchestrator issues (missing replication_info.json path error and initial hard-coded CSV path), so no model estimates were produced. In addition, the provided dataset appears to differ from the original paper's data (CSV labeled 2014 and at a finer polling-center level versus the original 2009 district-level sample), which limits exact-data fidelity even if code runs successfully. Because the execution did not complete, the preregistered comparison (negative, significant squared-violence term) could not be evaluated on the provided data.",

    "method_alignment": "Partial alignment. The executed plan (translation of the Stata .do into a Python script that fits logit models with linear and squared violence terms, computes margins, and clusters SEs by regional command) matches the preregistered methods. The replication script implements the same covariates, computes squared terms, and attempts cluster-robust SEs. However, the run failed before model outputs were produced, and the supplied dataset differs from the original paper's reported unit/year (polling-center/2014 CSV vs original district/2009 analyses), reducing fidelity to an exact replication.",

(2) Once the script runs, inspect model_5_coefs.csv and model_60_coefs.csv to check the sign and significance of the squared-violence term; produce margins CSVs and inspect peak location. (3) If exact replication is desired, obtain/aggregate to the original 2009 district-level data and re-run models; compare coefficient magnitudes, SEs, and p-values against the reported original squared-term (−13.748, SE 4.720, p<0.01). (4) Perform sensitivity checks: verify binary fraud coding, test alternative clustering (multiway), and assess robustness to aggregation choice. Finally, after successful runs, report N used in models and any differences that explain deviations from the original results."

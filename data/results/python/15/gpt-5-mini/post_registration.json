      "description": "The study develops a theoretical model predicting an inverted U-shaped relationship between violence and local election fraud driven by candidates' loyalty networks. Empirically, it uses district- and polling-station-level election returns, applies a last-digit forensic test (Beber\u2013Scacco) to detect suspicious vote-count patterns, validates forensic measures with a recount/audit of randomly sampled ballot boxes (ECC recount), and links fraud measures to fine-grained geocoded violence/event data. Regression analyses (OLS and logit variants) with controls and spatial specifications test the inverted U-shape and differential spatial displacement for incumbent versus contender fraud.",

      "summary": "The study finds empirical support for the theoretical prediction of an inverted U-shaped relationship between violence and election fraud: fraud rises with violence up to a point and then declines in high-violence districts where loyalty-network operations are disrupted. Validation of the last-digit forensic measure with ECC recount data shows a positive correlation between last-digit test significance and recount-based evidence of manipulated ballot boxes. Candidate-specific analyses indicate differing patterns: the incumbent's fraud network is relatively embedded in the electoral apparatus and less spatially displaced, while the contender's fraud efforts show spatial displacement (negative correlation with local violence and positive correlation with nearby violence). The authors note limitations regarding causality and generalizability beyond contexts where violence is not biased toward a particular candidate.",

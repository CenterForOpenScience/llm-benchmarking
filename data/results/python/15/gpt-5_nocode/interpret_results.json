  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed OLS (LPM) models with clustered SEs by regional command and election-round fixed effects on a 2014 Afghanistan district-by-round dataset, in line with the preregistration. The squared violence term is negative and statistically significant, and the linear term is positive and significant for both the 5-day and 60-day windows, consistent with an inverted U-shaped relationship between violence and fraud. A planned logistic model with clustered SEs failed due to a method attribute error, but the primary OLS results meet the preregistered inference criteria. Coefficient magnitudes differ from the original due to different data, units, and outcome construction, but the shape and significance align with the original claim.",

Alternatively, compute cluster-robust sandwich covariance manually, use wild cluster bootstrap for few clusters, or switch to R's glm with clubSandwich or glmmTMB for clustered SEs."

  ],
  "notes": "The replication uses a different year (2014) and a binary district-level fraud indicator, whereas the original employed polling-station/district last-digit tests validated by ECC recount in 2009. Magnitude comparisons are not directly interpretable due to different scales and outcome definitions; sign and significance are the appropriate comparison. With only six clusters, cluster-robust inference may be sensitive; consider wild cluster bootstrap for more reliable p-values. Future work could test adjacent-district violence and candidate-specific fraud patterns to mirror additional original mechanisms."

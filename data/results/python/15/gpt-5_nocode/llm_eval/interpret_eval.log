Replication of a Research Claim from Weidmann and Callen (2013), from British Journal

Background: Violence and insecurity has consistently been found to increase election fraud in 
developing countries. Weidmann and Callen (2013) hypothesized that this positive association will 
hold up to a point, whereupon more severe levels of violence will serve to undermine the 
effectiveness of organized fraudulent networks. Weidmann and Callen (2013) analyzed data from 
the 2009 Afghanistan presidential election and found supporting evidence for this inverted U-
shaped hypothesis. The current project replicates their study by analyzing data on the 2014 
Afghanistan presidential election. 
 
Claim Summary: The claim selected for replication from Weidmann and Callen (2013) is that 
the relationship between (in)security and election fraud should be in the form of an inverted U-
shape. Fraud increases with violence up to a certain level, but then decreases again. This reflects 
the following statement from the paper’s abstract: “It predicts (i) that the relationship between 
violence and fraud follows an inverted U-shape and (ii) that loyalty networks of both incumbent 
and challenger react differently to the security situation on the ground. Disaggregated violence and 
election results data from the 2009 Afghanistan presidential election provide empirical results 
consistent with this theory.” The claim is tested with the logit models presented in Table 2. The 
dependent variable is a binary measure of fraud, calculated by grouping polling stations by district 
and applying the Beber–Scacco last-digit test to the total vote count (Beber & Scacco, 2012). The 
dependent variable takes the value of 1 if this test is significant at the 5 percent level for a particular 
district. The authors measure violence as the number of attacks per capita against the International 
Security Assistance Force (ISAF). In Model 1 (the model selected as evidence for the SCORE 
program from Table 2), it is included in both linear and squared form. In conjunction with a 

3 
 
positive and significant coefficient for the linear term, the claim is tested with the coefficient on 
the squared term. 
 
Replication Criteria: The hypotheses tested for this replication include the following: 
H1: The linear association between violence and election fraud will be positive.  
H* (SCORE focal test): The quadratic association between violence and election fraud will 
be negative. 
The SCORE focal test references the quadratic term in the original model (Table 2, Model 1). The 
alternative hypothesis (H1) references the linear term in the same model, which is consistent with 
the original hypothesis specified by Weidmann and Callen (2013:58): “The relationship between 
(in)security and election fraud should be in the form of an inverted U-shape. Fraud increases with 
violence up to a certain level, but then decreases again.” Testing the combination of H1 and H* 
will more fully assess this broader claim posed in the original study. The criteria for a successful 
replication attempt is a statistically significant effect (p < .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as 
the original study on the focal hypothesis tests (H1 and H*). For this study, this criteria is met by 
a positive and significant coefficient on the linear term for election violence (H1) and a negative 
and significant coefficient on the squared term for election violence (H*) in the focal regression 
model. 
 
Replication Result: We first present descriptive statistics for the variables included in the 
regression models in Table 1. Summary statistics (Mean [SD]) reported here are generally 
consistent with those reported in Table 1 in Weidmann and Callen (2013) for fraud (0.16 [0.37] 
vs. 0.18 [0.39]), election violence (0.03 [0.08] vs. 0.03 [0.08]), pre-election violence (0.24 [0.55] 

4 
 
vs. 0.23 [0.52]), distance from Kabul (276.73 [181.30] vs. 275.40 [180.93]), and elevation 
(1874.03 [916.51] vs. 1880.00 [921.85]). Key differences are observed for per-capita expenditures 
(1.57 [1.12] vs. 4.16 [2.38]), electrification (0.85 [0.20] vs. 0.31 [0.30]), and polling closures (8.30 
[17.71] vs. 10.69 [19.78]). Note that, as explained below, the latter variable is operationalized 
differently here as ‘Percentage of centers closed’ versus ‘Number of planned stations closed’ in 
the original study. Note that the target analytic sample was the maximum possible analytic sample 
of N=800 (based on number of districts and election cycles); due to missing data on development 
control variables, the final analytic sample was N=724. 
 
Replication results examining the effect of insurgent violence on election fraud are presented in 
Table 2. For Model 1, the significant positive effect of violence (b = 21.22 [SE = 5.05], p = 
0.00003) and significant negative effect of violence squared (b = -92.44 [SE = 37.2], p = 0.0128) 
on fraud successfully replicates the results reported by Weidmann and Callen (2013) in Table 2, 
Model 1. These results are visualized in Figure 1, Panel 1. Similarly, for Model 2, the significant 
positive effect of violence (b = 2.63 [SE = 0.97], p = 6.269e-42) and significant negative effect of 
violence squared (b = -1.18 [SE = 0.46], p = 0.0000001) on fraud successfully replicates the results 
reported by Weidmann and Callen (2013) in Table 2, Model 2. These results are visualized in 
Figure 1, Panel 1. As a sensitivity analysis to one-way clustering, models 3 and 4 repeat these 
analyses with multiway clustering by regional command and election cycle. In both instances, the 
replication results are confirmed by these sensitivity analyses, with results visualized in Figure 1, 
Panels 3 and 4, respectively. To summarize, all analyses successfully replicated the SCORE claim 
(H*) and its associated alternative hypothesis (H1).   
 

5 
 
Deviations from the Original Study: We had one key measurement difference in the replication. 
Namely, our measure of ‘Percentage of polling centers closed’ differs from Weidmann and 
Callen’s (2013) analogous measure of ‘Number of closed polling stations.’ We deviate from their 
measure for two reasons. First, data on the number of planned polling stations is unreliably 
measured; we have more confidence in data on planned polling centers. Second, normalizing by 
the number of planned centers adjusts for underlying district population differences as reflected 
by number of polling centers. Weidmann and Callen (2013) did not normalize polling station 
counts because each station is limited to collecting 600 ballots, so normalization was inherent in 
the measure. This is not the case with polling centers, which can support variable numbers of 
polling stations. We therefore normalize the measure as a percentage to make the measure 
meaningful in context. Analytically, while the main replication Models 1 and 2 were estimated 
similarly to the original, we estimated Models 3 and 4 to account for multiway clustering to 
account for both regional command (same as original) and election cycle (unique to this replication 
due to combining data from the 2014 initial and runoff elections).  
 
Deviations from Preregistration: The replication differs from the preregistration in minor ways. 
First, we had proposed to alter the scaling of two control variables (electrification, elevation) to 
aid interpretation of results, but we chose to keep the scaling the same as the original in the final 
analyses. Second, we revised the analytic script to export results in tabular and graphical form. 
This revised script is available on the OSF project page (Weidmann_Data_Analysis_Final.do).

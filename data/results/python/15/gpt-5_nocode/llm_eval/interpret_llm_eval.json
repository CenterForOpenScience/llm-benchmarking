    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The issue description about listwise deletion reducing the sample size is consistent with the reference document, which notes the reduction in sample size due to missing data."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The impact assessment of the listwise deletion is accurately described as low, consistent with the reference document's indication that the key coefficients remained significant."
  },

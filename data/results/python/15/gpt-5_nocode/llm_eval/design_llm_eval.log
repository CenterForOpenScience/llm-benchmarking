3. Description of study  
 
The claim selected for replication from Weidmann & Callen (2013) is that the relationship between 
(in)security and election fraud should be in the form of an inverted U-shape. Fraud increases with 
violence up to a certain level, but then decreases again (Hypothesis 1). This reflects the following 
statement from the paper's abstract: "It predicts (i) that the relationship between violence and 
fraud follows an inverted U-shape and (ii) that loyalty networks of both incumbent and challenger 
react differently to the security situation on the ground. Disaggregated violence and election 
results data from the 2009 Afghanistan presidential election provide empirical results consistent 
with this theory." The claim is tested with the logit models presented in Table 2. The dependent 
variable is a binary measure of fraud, calculated by grouping polling stations by district and 
applying the Beber–Scacco last-digit test to the total vote count. The dependent variable takes 
the value of 1 if this test is significant at the 5 percent level for a particular district. The authors 
measure violence as the number of attacks per capita against the International Security 
Assistance Force (ISAF). In Model 1 (the model selected as evidence for the SCORE program), 
it is included in both linear and squared form. In conjunction with a positive and significant 
coefficient for the linear term, the claim is tested with the coefficient on the squared term (see 
Model 1 for specification details). Model 1 confirms Hypothesis 1, since the linear term of the 
violence measure receives a positive and significant coefficient, and the squared term a negative 
one (coefficient on Violence (election, squared) term = -13.748, SE clustered at the regional 
command level = 4.720, p < 0.01). 
 

 
4. Hypotheses 
 
H1: The linear association between violence and election fraud will be positive.  
H* (SCORE focal test): The quadratic association between violence and election fraud will be 
negative. 
 
The SCORE focal test references the quadratic term in the original model (Table 2, Model 1). The 
alternative hypothesis (H1) references the linear term in the same model, which is consistent with 
Hypothesis 1 as specified by Weidmann and Callen (2013): “The relationship between (in)security 
and election fraud should be in the form of an inverted U-shape. Fraud increases with violence 
up to a certain level, but then decreases again.” Testing the combination of H1 and H* will more 
fully assess this broader claim posed in the original study.  
 
Design Plan

8. Study design 
 
This replication study will employ a cross-sectional observational research design to examine the 
association between insurgent violence and election fraud. Consistent with Weidmann and Callen 
(2013), this design explores the general pattern of fraud in response to violence, which cannot 
produce a strong causal test of the predicted association due to the lack of exogenous variation.  
 

 
The study setting remains Afghanistan as in the original study, but the current study will analyze 
returns from the 2014 Presidential election to replicate Weidmann and Callen’s (2013) analysis 
of the 2009 Presidential election. It should be noted that since no candidate won a majority of 
votes in the April 5, 2014 election, a runoff election was held on June 14, 2014 between the top 
two vote-getters (Abdullah Abdullah, Ashraf Ghani). We focus on the pooled voting results for 
both elections in this replication to increase power for the study. The unit of analysis remains the 
district, which is the second-level administrative unit in Afghanistan below the province.

Sampling Plan 
10. Existing data 
 
Registration will occur prior to analysis of the data 
 
11. Explanation of existing data 
 
This study will collect, aggregate, and merge secondary data from various sources to construct a 
replication analysis data file. With respect to the original study, all data used for the replication 
reflects the updated time frame (i.e., 2014 vs. 2009).  
12. Data collection procedures 
 
Secondary data collection procedures for the replication analysis will be consistent with the 
original study. In particular, secondary data will be obtained from the following sources. Data for 
the 2014 Afghanistan presidential election have been made publicly available here by the National 
Democratic Institute (NDI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan, nongovernmental organization based in 
Washington, DC. Though the replication data purveyor (National Democratic Institute) is different 
from the original study, the source of the data is the same (International Election Commission of 
Afghanistan). NDI data are sourced for this project because they are provided in a more 
accessible digitized form. The election data provide information on election returns, polling 
centers, province and district names, and geographic coordinates of districts. Data on violent 
insurgent activity in Afghanistan have been digitized from declassified ‘significant activity’ reports 
released by US Central Command and made publicly available here by researcher Vincent Bauer 
(SigActs). Again, although sourced differently from the original study, the data are similarly 
derived from military significant activity reports. Development data from the 2013-2014 
Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey (ALCS) can be requested here from the Afghanistan 

 
government’s National Statistics and Information Authority (NSIA). The ALCS is the successor to 
the 2007 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) survey used in the original study. 
Elevation data (mean district elevation) comes from the World Bank here, which was derived from 
enhanced land elevation data produced by NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). 
The original study used elevation data aggregated to the district level based on the US Geological 
Survey. Because elevation for nine districts was not reported in the World Bank data, we manually 
searched for elevation information by district latitude and longitude coordinates using Google 
Earth. Thus, for these nine districts, elevation is measured at one point on the map rather than as 
a district average from multiple locations. Distance to Kabul from each district is measured as the 
great circle distance on a spherical earth, identical to the original study. This distance measure 
was calculated within Stata using the -geodist- command based on latitude and longitude 
coordinates. Finally, population data have been formatted from official Afghan sources and made 
publicly available by researcher Colin Cookman here. Population data in the original study were 
based on the LandScan Global Population database.  
13. Sample size 
 
The unit of analysis is the district. For the 2009 Afghanistan election, Weidmann and Callen (2013) 
analyzed data from 398 districts (with a corresponding analytic sample of N=375 due to missing 
data). Various official district maps have been issued since then, some with as many as 422 
districts (see here for more background information). Based on these updated district maps and 
election reporting results, the current replication is based on a 408 district set. However, election 
results were returned from just 399 districts for the first election and 401 districts for the runoff 
election. Thus, because we are pooling first and runoff election results for this replication, the 
maximum analytic sample is N=800. Since the unit of analysis in this replication is finite and 
already maximized, there will be no planned second-stage supplemental data collection and 
analysis with a larger sample.   
 
 
14. Sample size rationale 
 
Sample size is predetermined by the study design and context.  
 
Power calculations were done in accordance with the guidelines of the Social Sciences 
Replication Project (SSRP). The first round of data collection aims to achieve 90% power to detect 
75% of the original effect size. A second-round sample, although not planned as part of this 
replication, would achieve 90% power to detect 50% of the original effect size.

15. Stopping rule 
 
The target sample size is N=800, which reflects actual district-level election returns across the 
first (N=399) and runoff (N=401) elections. This number more than doubles the original study’s 
maximum sample size of N=398 because of an increase in the number of districts and pooling of 
2014 presidential initial and runoff election results. There is no plan for a second stage of data 
collection, and thus there is no stopping rule.

Dependent Variable: Election Fraud 
Election data are reported at the polling station level (i.e., ballot collection points), which are 
nested within polling centers (e.g., mosque, school) within districts. As with the original study, 
voting data at the polling station level will be used to develop district-level measures of election 
fraud. We will use Beber and Scacco’s (2012) ‘last-digit measure’ methodology to create a district-
level binary dependent variable, where evidence of election fraud = ‘1’ and lack of such evidence 
= ‘0.’ In particular, election fraud is indicated when the within-district distribution of the last digit 
among polling station vote totals deviates significantly (p<0.05) from the expected uniform 
distribution. The use of Beber and Scacco’s (2012) last-digit method exactly replicates the 
operationalization in the original study.  
 
Focal Independent Variable: Violence 
Weidmann and Callan (2013) measured district-level insurgent violence as “the number of attacks 
per capita against the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), [defined] as the total of 
insurgent-initiated direct fire incidents, incidents involving improvised explosive devices (IEDs), 
and small arms fire [occurring] in a five-day window around election day.” Like Weidmann and 
Callen (2013), replication data on insurgent violence in Afghanistan come from declassified 
military ‘significant activity’ or SigAct reports released by US Central Command. The data used 
for the replication have been collected, digitized, and made publicly available by researcher 
Vincent Bauer. These data comprise N=431,547 geographically and temporally referenced events 

 
for the period January 2008 to December 2014. The replication study will follow Weidmann and 
Callen’s (2013) operationalization of insurgent violence, defined as the number of insurgent 
violent events occurring in a five-day window surrounding election day (i.e., April 5-9, 2014 for 
first election and June 14-18, 2014 for runoff election) at the district level. Similar to the original 
study, insurgent violent events are defined as enemy actions involving (i) assassinations, direct 
fire, or small arms fire, or (ii) IED/mine explosive hazards.  
 
In addition to the main results reported in Table 2, Model 1, Weidmann and Callen (2013) also 
reported in Table 2, Model 2 a supplemental analysis measuring violence during a wider sixty-
day window prior to election day. We will replicate this supplemental analysis using the extended 
window of observation. Consistent with Weidmann and Callen (2013), both violence measures 
will be aggregated to the district level and operationalized as incidents per 1,000 population. 
 
Control Variables 
Percentage of planned polling centers closed. This measure is operationalized from NDI election 
data as the number of closed polling centers on election day divided by the total number of 
planned polling stations prior to election day, multiplied by 100. This measure differs from 
Weidmann and Callen (2013), who measured the number of closed polling stations. We deviate 
from this measure for two reasons. First, data on the number of planned polling stations is 
unreliably measured; we have more confidence in data on planned polling centers. Second, 
normalizing by the number of planned centers adjusts for underlying district population differences 
as reflected by number of polling centers. Weidmann and Callen (2013) did not normalize polling 
station counts because each station is limited to collecting 600 ballots, so normalization was 
inherent in the measure. This is not the case with polling centers, which can support variable 
numbers of polling stations. We therefore normalize the measure as a percentage to make the 
measure meaningful in context.  
 
Electrification. Weidman and Callen (2013) developed a measure of proportion of households 
with electricity from the 2007 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) survey, 
administered by the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) and the Central 
Statistics Office (CSO) of Afghanistan, and based on information from N=20,576 households in 
383 districts. A similar measure of electrification will be created from the 2013-2014 Afghanistan 
Living Conditions Survey (ALCS), the successor to the NVRA, which was based on information 
from N=20,786 households in 364 districts. Although Weidmann and Callen (2013) do not 
explicitly describe how they operationalized this measure from NRVA questionnaire items, we will 
operationalize this measure as the survey weighted percentage of households within each district 
answering affirmatively to any response option for the following question: “Has your household 
had electricity at any time in the past month from any of these sources?: Electric grid, Government 
generator, Private generator (engine), Private generator (hydro), Community generator (engine), 
Community generator (hydro), Solar, Wind, Battery.” Our operationalization differs from Weidman 
and Callen (2013) in scaling: rather than a proportion (0-1) we express this measure as a 
percentage (0-100) to improve model interpretation.  
 

 
Per capita expenditure. Weidmann and Callen (2013) also developed a measure of per capita 
expenditure by households using the NRVA, but again were not explicit about how they 
operationalized this measure from NRVA questionnaire items. We will operationalize a weighted 
measure of past-month per capita expenditures (in Afghanis) using the 2013-14 ALCS. In 
particular, we will operationalize this measure as follows: 
1. Sum the reported past-month household expenditures (“How much did this household 
spend in the last month for each type of fuel used in the household?: Electricity; Gas; Fuel 
oil; Firewood; Ping, straw, manure”) and other household costs (“In the past month, how 
much did your household spend on the following categories of items? Food at home; Food 
away from home; Grooming, cosmetics, laundry soap, shampoo; Housing rent; 
Communication (phone, internet); Transportation of household members”). 
2. Sum the reported past-year household expenditures for other household expenses (“In 
the past year, how much did your household spend on the following categories of items?: 
Clothing and shoes; Health services and medicines; Education (tuition, books, uniform, 
supplies”), and then divide by 12 to obtain average monthly expenditures.  
3. Sum the past-month and average past-month household expenditure amounts from steps 
1 and 2. 
4. Sum the survey weighted total expenditure amounts by district. 
5. Divide by 1,000 to express expenditures in thousands of Afghanis. 
6. Divide by the district population to express as per capita household expenditures.  
 
Distance to Kabul. Data on the distance (km) from each district to Kabul is measured as the great 
circle distance on a spherical earth, as with the original study. This measure will be 
operationalized as the straight-line distance from each district center to the capital of Kabul based 
on latitude and longitude coordinates. In particular, we used the user-written Stata command -
geodist- to calculate these distances.  
 
Elevation. Average elevation data (in kilometers) for each district are based on World Bank staff 
estimates of 2015 satellite data from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), 
supplemented for missing data in nine districts by using Google Earth queries by geographic 
coordinates. By comparison, Weidmann and Callen (2013) calculated elevation from US 
Geological Survey data. Our operationalization differs from Weidman and Callen (2013) in 
scaling: we express as kilometers rather than meters to improve model interpretation.  
  
Population. Population data used to normalize other measures are captured at the district level to 
a specificity in the thousands based on official government statistics.  
 
Clustering variable. Weidmann and Callen (2013) clustered their analyses by coalition forces 
regional commands (RCs). In 2009, the 34 provinces were clustered into one of four RCs. By 
2014, the number of RCs had expanded to six (see here). Our main clustering variable keys on 
these six RCs.

19. Statistical models 
 
For the purposes of SCORE, to test the combination of H1 and H* in line with the original paper 
(Table 2, Model 1), we will use logit models to regress the last-digit fraud measure on violence 
and its squared term to test the inverted U-shaped hypotheses, while controlling for covariates 
indicated above. The measure of violence in this model is the incidence rate per 1,000 population 
within a 5-day window around election day.  
 
We will also perform a supplemental analysis using the alternative measure of violence defined 
as the incidence rate per 1,000 population during a 60-day window preceding election day (Table 
2, Model 2).   
 
For both analyses, we will estimate cluster-robust standard errors by regional command, 
consistent with Weidmann and Callen (2013). We will also estimate supplemental models using 
multiway clustering grouped by regional command and election cycle to additionally account for 
pooling of election results.  
 
All analyses will be performed using Stata MP 16.1. Analytic code is provided on the OSF project 
page in a Stata do file (Weidmann_Data_Analysis.do). Test results of the planned analyses on a 
5% random sample of the data is provided on the OSF project page. The results demonstrate the 
analytic code works properly.  
 
20. Transformations 
 
We will use a quadratic (i.e., squared) term for the focal independent variable, violence, to test 
the nonlinear hypothesis that election fraud will increase as violence increases to a point, 
whereupon election fraud will decline at higher levels of violence.  
 
21. Inference criteria 
 
Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project is a statistically significant 
effect (p < .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal hypothesis tests 
(H1 and H*). For this study, this criteria is met by a positive and significant coefficient on the linear 

 
term for election violence (H1) and a negative and significant coefficient on the squared term for 
election violence (H*) in the focal regression model. 
 
22. Data exclusion 
 
We do not have any a priori exclusion criteria for observations in our sample.  
 
23. Missing data 
 
Consistent with Weidmann and Callen (2013), we will perform a complete case analysis. In the 
original study, this resulted in the loss of 6% of the data (375/398). In the current replication, a 
complete case analysis is expected to result in the loss of 76 observations, or less than 10% of 
the data (724/800), due to missingness on the ALCS measures.

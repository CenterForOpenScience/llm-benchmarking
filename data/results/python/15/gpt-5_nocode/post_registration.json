      "description": "The study applies a forensic last-digit (Beber\u2013Scacco) test to polling-station returns to flag potential manipulation, validates these signals against an ECC-ordered 10% ballot box recount, and models how violence relates to detected fraud using regression analyses. Violence is measured from declassified ISAF combat incident reports and linked to districts, including both local and adjacent-district measures and both short- and long-term windows. Models test an inverted U-shaped relationship (linear and squared terms for violence) and differential spatial displacement of fraud benefiting the incumbent versus the challenger, controlling for geography, development, logistics, and demographics.",
      "steps": [
        "Assemble polling station\u2013level election returns from the 2009 Afghan presidential election.",
        "Compute last-digit frequencies for vote counts by district (and candidate) and perform chi-square tests against a uniform distribution to generate district-level p-values indicating potential fraud.",
        "Obtain ECC recount results (10% random sample of boxes) and construct recount-based fraud indicators/ratios by fraud category.",
        "Validate the last-digit test by correlating significant last-digit flags with recount-based fraud measures.",
        "Compile violence measures from declassified ISAF combat incident reports; georeference incidents to districts; compute violence per 1,000 population for election-day and longer-term windows; compute adjacent-district violence.",
        "Assemble controls (e.g., NRVA 2007 economic development, distance from Kabul, elevation from GTOPO30, electrification, LandScan population, number of closed stations; optionally ACLED/WITS events).",
        "Estimate regression models (logit/OLS) relating fraud indicators to violence, including linear and squared terms (testing for an inverted U-shaped relationship).",
        "Estimate models separating fraud benefiting the incumbent vs. challenger, including adjacent-district violence to test spatial displacement.",
        "Assess robustness across datasets, time windows, and specifications; interpret coefficients and significance patterns."

    "results": {
      "summary": "Fraud and violence exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship: fraud increases with moderate violence but declines at high violence levels. Fraud benefiting the incumbent shows no spatial displacement with neighboring violence, whereas fraud benefiting the challenger increases with adjacent-district violence and decreases with local violence, consistent with differences in loyalty networks. The last-digit forensic test aligns with recount evidence, indicating that a substantial share of boxes in flagged districts was manipulated.",

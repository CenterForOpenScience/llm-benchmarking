        "explanation": "This dataset contains district-level fraud and violence measures necessary to test the inverted U-shaped relationship central to the original claim. It provides two time windows for violence (5-day and 60-day incident rates per 1,000), and controls aligning with the original (e.g., electrification, expenditures, elevation, distance to Kabul). Using a different election year (2014) creates an out-of-sample test while preserving core constructs.",
        "similarity_to_original": "Original paper relies on polling-station/district-level fraud measures validated by ECC recount and violence from declassified ISAF incident reports with controls such as NRVA, LandScan, elevation, and distance (post_registration.json: original_study.data.source; method description). The replication dataset includes SIGACTS-based incident rates per 1,000 in 5- and 60-day windows (sigact_5r, sigact_60r; Codebook_Afghanistan_Election_Violence_2014 (1).pdf) and controls: electric/electricp (electrification), pcexpend (per capita expenditure), elevationk (km), dist (distance to Kabul), and population (pop_1314) allowing log-pop calculation\u2014matching the original constructs (post_registration.json method controls, and the codebook/dataset columns).",
        "deviation_from_original": "The original focal analysis centers on the 2009 presidential election with fraud measured via last-digit tests validated against a 10% ECC recount (post_registration.json method steps), whereas this dataset covers the 2014 presidential election (first and second rounds; elect variable in codebook) with a binary district-level fraud indicator (fraud) rather than district-level last-digit p-values; see Codebook_Afghanistan_Election_Violence_2014 (1).pdf which lists fraud as 0/1 and elect as 1st/2nd Election. The sample frame also differs in unique districts (392 vs. ~398 in original; codebook shows 392 unique districts), and violence windows are specified as 5-day and 60-day rates for 2014 rather than 2009 elections (dataset columns sigact_5r, sigact_60r)."

  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10 Docker image with pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and scipy. Resolved a container runtime image name mismatch by building the image as 'replication-exec'. Started the container, planned execution, and obtained approval to run the Python entrypoint replication_data/afghan_replication__py.py. The script loaded the Afghanistan_Election_Violence_2014.csv dataset, constructed variables, and estimated OLS (LPM) models with clustered SEs by regional command and election-round fixed effects. Logistic regression with clustered robust covariance encountered an attribute error and was skipped. The primary OLS results support the inverted U-shaped relationship: the squared violence term is negative and significant, with the linear term positive and significant for both 5-day and 60-day windows. Outputs were saved to replication_data/replication_results.json and replication_data/replication_coefficients.csv.",

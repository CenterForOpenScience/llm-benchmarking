  "interpretation_summary": "The replication study aimed to test the hypothesis that political polarization negatively affects the size of government in strong democracies. The replication was executed successfully using a Python script, and the results were consistent with the original study's findings. The coefficient for political polarization was negative, although not statistically significant, similar to the original study. The replication maintained high fidelity to the original study's methodology, with minor deviations in data waves used.",

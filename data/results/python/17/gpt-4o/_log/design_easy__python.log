    First, determine whether the provided data can be used for replicating the provided focal claim. 
    - Ensure that all necessary variables are available.
    - Ensure that the data qualify for replication criteria. Replication data achieves its purpose by being different data collected under similar/identical conditions, thus testing if the phenomenon is robust across independent instances.
    
    If you find issues with the provided data, follow-up with a human supervisor to ask for a different data source until appropriate data is given.
    
    Once you have determined the provided data are good for replication, explore the code to help fill out fields related to the codebase. This code will operate directly on the data files given to you.
    Find potential issues with the provided code such as a data file path that is different from the data files you have looked at.
    - If the code reads any data file, the file path must be in this directory "/app/data".
    - If the code dumps content or produce additional content, the file must also be in this directory "/app/data".
    
    RUN POLICY (DESIGN)
- Translate every non-Python analysis script (.R/.do/etc.) into Python.
- Keep originals unchanged; write new files like: <basename>__py.py
- Ensure all IO uses /app/data.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code so that it is compatible. 
- Set the executed entrypoint to the Python rewrite (or a Python wrapper that runs the translated scripts in order).
- Preserve logic, outputs, and seeds as closely as possible.
- Make sure that replication_info.json reflects the change. All docker related information must also be compatible with Python execution.

    If your code reads in any data file, ASSUME that the data will be in this directory: "/app/data".
    If you code produce any addtional files, the code must save the files in this directory: "/app/data".

    File operations policy:
    - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
    - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
    - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.
    
    After all issues have been resolved, finish by complete by filling out the required JSON with all the updated/final information to prepare for replication execution.

2026-01-08 13:39:21,744 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Observation: [CLAIM]
Political polarization is strongly associatedwith smaller government in democratic countries, but there is no relationship between polarization and the size ofgovernment in undemocratic countries. When the sample is restricted to strong democracies, the estimated effect of polarization on government consumption is statistically significant (coefficient in the ‘long’ specification for the “Private” measure of polarization=-18.73, heteroscedasticity robust SE=4.79, p=.01)

[HYPOTHESIS]
Among strong democracies (countries with a Polity IV score of 9 or greater), polarization (as measured by the SD of the “private ownership” responses) will be negatively associated with the size of government
2026-01-08 13:39:23,716 - replication - INFO - ***Agent output:
Thought: I now have the focal claim and hypothesis from the original study. The claim involves the relationship between political polarization and government size in democratic countries, with a specific focus on strong democracies. The hypothesis is that polarization will be negatively associated with government size in these countries. Next, I will read the `post_registration.json` to gather structured information about the original study, which will help in planning the replication study.

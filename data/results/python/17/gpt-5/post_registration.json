      "summary": "Electorate polarization is negatively associated with government size in strong democracies and near zero in weak democracies. In strong democracies, a one standard deviation increase in polarization reduces government consumption by roughly 2.0\u20136.1 percentage points (about 4.0 pp on average). Results are robust to controls (income inequality, corruption, trust, consensus, response rates), alternative polarization measures, and to using transfers/subsidies as the outcome. Evidence suggests polarization influences spending rather than the reverse; party/government fragmentation measures do not consistently mediate the relationship.",

This constitutes a measurement deviation within the same WVS polarization family used in the original paper\u2019s robustness set. Additionally, the R script targeted output/data.csv paths and wave filtering; our Python rewrite reads /app/data/original/17/0112_python_gpt5/replication_data/data.csv and writes outputs to /app/data to comply with the current environment."

{
  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The summary captures the core elements of the replication attempt, including the use of OLS model, dataset of strong democracies, and key predictor and outcome variables. However, it deviates from the original focal measure and does not mention the specific time frame (2010-2014) or the exact nature of the original hypothesis. The comparison with the original finding is mostly similar but lacks some specific details from the reference document."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The execution status is correctly reported as 'Success', which aligns with the reference document indicating that the replication was carried out as planned."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The method alignment is mostly similar to the reference, capturing the use of OLS with HC1 robust SEs and the filtering of strong democracies. However, it does not mention the specific time frame or the exact nature of the original hypothesis."

    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The issue description accurately identifies the deviation in the key independent variable used in the replication, which matches the reference document."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].impact": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The impact assessment is consistent with the reference document, noting the moderate effect on the results due to the deviation in the key independent variable."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The issue description regarding operational deviations is mostly similar to the reference, but lacks specific details about the supplementary data for Trinidad and Tobago and the use of Polity5 instead of Polity IV."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact assessment is mostly similar, noting that the deviations were resolved and did not affect the final estimates, but lacks specific details about the supplementary data and Polity5 usage."
  },
  "results_comparison.hypothesis_tested": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis tested is accurately restated, matching the reference document's description of the focal hypothesis."

    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The replication results are accurately reported, including the key numerical values and the lack of statistical significance, which matches the reference document."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The overall answer correctly states that the replication did not satisfy the preregistered comparison criterion for significance, which aligns with the reference document."
  },
  "replication_report": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The replication report accurately summarizes the overall results, noting the non-significant association and the contrast with the original focal result, which matches the reference document."

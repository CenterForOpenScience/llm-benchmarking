{
  "hypothesis": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted hypothesis is mostly similar to the reference. Both mention the negative association between polarization and government consumption in strong democracies. However, the extracted hypothesis uses 'electorate polarization' and 'government-responsibility item' which are not explicitly mentioned in the reference."
  },
  "study_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The study type is correctly identified as 'Observational' in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.dataset_identifier": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The extracted dataset identifier mentions 'WVS-derived cross-country panel with macro controls' which is not explicitly detailed in the reference document. The reference mentions using WVS data but does not specify this exact identifier."
  },
  "data_plan.source_type": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted source type is mostly similar to the reference. Both mention the use of WVS data and macro indicators, but the extracted JSON provides more specific details about the merging process which are not present in the reference."
  },
  "data_plan.wave_or_subset": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted wave or subset information is mostly similar to the reference. Both mention using data from strong democracies with a democracy score of 9-10, but the extracted JSON includes additional details about optional exclusion of WVS wave 7 and year approximation."
  },
  "data_plan.sample_size": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The extracted sample size information is loosely related to the reference. The reference provides specific numbers for strong democracies in different WVS waves, while the extracted JSON mentions a sample size to be determined at runtime."
  },
  "data_plan.unit_of_analysis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The unit of analysis is correctly identified as 'Country-year' in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.access_details": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The extracted access details mention a specific file path and no external access required, which is not mentioned in the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.notes": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted notes are mostly similar to the reference. Both mention the variables present and the focus on strong democracies, but the extracted JSON includes more specific details about the dataset structure and deviations."
  },
  "planned_method.steps": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted steps are mostly similar to the reference. Both describe the process of loading data, filtering, and running OLS regression, but the extracted JSON includes additional procedural details not present in the reference."
  },
  "planned_method.models": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The model used is correctly identified as 'OLS linear regression with HC1 robust standard errors' in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "planned_method.outcome_variable": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The outcome variable 'gov_consumption (government consumption as % of GDP)' is correctly identified in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "planned_method.independent_variables": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The independent variables are mostly similar to the reference. Both mention 'sd_gov' and 'mean_gov' as primary variables, but the extracted JSON includes additional controls not explicitly listed in the reference."
  },
  "planned_method.control_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The control variables are correctly identified in both the extracted JSON and the reference document, including region, colonial history, and macroeconomic controls."
  },
  "planned_method.tools_software": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The tools and software used, including Python and specific packages, are correctly identified in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."

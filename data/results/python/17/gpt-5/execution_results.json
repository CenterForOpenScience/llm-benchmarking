  "execution_summary": "Built a Python-based replication environment in Docker. Initial build failed due to unquoted pip version constraints; fixed by quoting specs in the Dockerfile. Implemented analyze__py.py (Python translation of analyze.R) using statsmodels OLS with HC1 robust SEs, filtering strong democracies and handling optional wave 7 exclusion. First execution failed because the dataset was not found at /app/data; revised the script to resolve the dataset path across common mount points (/workspace/replication_data/data.csv, /app/data/...). Re-executed successfully. The focal hypothesis (negative association between polarization sd_gov and government consumption among strong democracies) is directionally negative but not statistically significant in either real-mode specification. Outputs saved under /app/data.",

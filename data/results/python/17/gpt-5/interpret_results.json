  "interpretation_summary": "The replication implemented an OLS model with HC1 robust SEs on a dataset of strong democracies (democ >= 9), using sd_gov (WVS government-responsibility polarization) as the key predictor and government consumption (% GDP) as the outcome. Two real-mode runs (wave 7 dropped vs kept) both yielded a negative coefficient on sd_gov but not statistically significant (p \u2248 0.40\u20130.41), with substantial R-squared (~0.79) and N \u2248 28\u201330. This aligns with the preregistered modeling approach but deviates from the original focal measure (PRIVATE-item polarization). Compared to the original finding in strong democracies (e.g., PRIVATE long spec: coef \u221218.73, SE 4.79, p=.01), the replication\u2019s effect is smaller in magnitude and not significant, failing the preregistered significance criterion.",

  "notes": "The non-significant findings may reflect measurement divergence (sd_gov vs PRIVATE-item), sample composition (N \u2248 28\u201330), and potential differences in timing/aggregation relative to the original cross-country averages. Directional consistency suggests construct alignment, but the lack of significance and smaller magnitude warrant caution. Future work should re-estimate using the PRIVATE-item polarization and replicate the original timing/averaging windows, along with robustness to alternative polarization constructions."

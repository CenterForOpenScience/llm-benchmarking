2. data/original/17/0112_python_gpt5/replication_info.json: Structured report of the agent at the PLANNING stage for the replication of the given claim.
3. data/original/17/0112_python_gpt5/replication_data: The folder containing the data and code that were used for the replication, along with any output files generated after running the code.

2026-01-13 03:16:52,380 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Observation: [CLAIM]
Political polarization is strongly associatedwith smaller government in democratic countries, but there is no relationship between polarization and the size ofgovernment in undemocratic countries. When the sample is restricted to strong democracies, the estimated effect of polarization on government consumption is statistically significant (coefficient in the ‘long’ specification for the “Private” measure of polarization=-18.73, heteroscedasticity robust SE=4.79, p=.01)

[HYPOTHESIS]
Among strong democracies (countries with a Polity IV score of 9 or greater), polarization (as measured by the SD of the “private ownership” responses) will be negatively associated with the size of government
2026-01-13 03:17:25,708 - replication - INFO - ***Agent output:
Thought: I have gathered key preregistration details, execution outputs, and original-claim numbers. I verified the replication outputs in the replication_data folder and matched them to execution_results.json. The focal coefficient on sd_gov is negative but not statistically significant in both real-mode specifications (drop/keep wave 7). The preregistered plan expected a negative and significant coefficient; thus, the replication does not meet the significance criterion. There is a documented deviation: original focal measure used “Private ownership” polarization; replication used sd_gov (government responsibility item), which is within the same WVS family but not identical to the focal measure. Execution encountered and resolved environment/path issues; otherwise, model specification and robust SEs align with the preregistration.

Answer: {
  "interpretation_summary": "The replication implemented an OLS model with HC1 robust SEs on a dataset of strong democracies (democ >= 9), using sd_gov (WVS government-responsibility polarization) as the key predictor and government consumption (% GDP) as the outcome. Two real-mode runs (wave 7 dropped vs kept) both yielded a negative coefficient on sd_gov but not statistically significant (p ≈ 0.40–0.41), with substantial R-squared (~0.79) and N ≈ 28–30. This aligns with the preregistered modeling approach but deviates from the original focal measure (PRIVATE-item polarization). Compared to the original finding in strong democracies (e.g., PRIVATE long spec: coef −18.73, SE 4.79, p=.01), the replication’s effect is smaller in magnitude and not significant, failing the preregistered significance criterion.",

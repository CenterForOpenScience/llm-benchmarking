The analyze__py.py script ran successfully (exit code 0) and produced four output files (test/real \u00d7 drop/keep wave 7). The preregistered focal hypothesis concerns the effect of polarization (sd_gov) among strong democracies (Polity IV >= 9). The executed analysis (analyze__py.py) did not subset to strong democracies; it ran on the provided sample and produced the results reported below. Overall the replication run completed successfully, but the executed specification does not match the preregistration restriction to strong democracies, so results are only partially aligned with the preregistration.",

The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

This study investigates the relationship between political polarization and the size of government, using the dispersion of self-reported political preferences as a measure of polarization. The key finding is that political polarization correlates with smaller government size in democratic countries, but not in undemocratic ones. The study finds that this relationship holds even after controlling for variables such as GDP per capita and income inequality.

Key methodologies include deriving measures of political polarization from survey data based on voters' self-reported preferences, contrasting this with indirect measures typically based on income, ethnicity, or religion. The study tests the influence of polarization on government size and explores whether the relationship might be causal. It does so by separating the sample based on the level of democratic development, theorizing that voter influence on spending is more pronounced in democracies.

Significant data points in the analysis include the comparison of government consumption as a fraction of total consumption between “weak” and “strong” democracies. For instance, government consumption in Sweden was 34.3% of total consumption compared to 17.6% in the U.S. in 2000. The correlation of polarization with government size was notably stronger in strong democracies.

The robustness of the results was verified by controlling for various factors that might correlate with polarization, such as economic conditions and social diversity. Furthermore, the study tackled potential endogeneity concerns related to income inequality and uncertainty over economic policy responses. The article concludes that political polarization might directly relate to government size and speculates on the mechanisms behind this observation, though it does not find legislative fragmentation as a significant factor. 

Overall, the research offers evidence suggesting that higher political polarization leads to reduced government size, especially under democratic conditions, although the causal mechanisms were not definitively established.

The article from the American Political Science Review examines the relationship between political polarization and government size using data from the World Values Survey (WVS). The study uses responses to four economic policy questions, measured on a 1-to-10 scale, as proxies for political polarization. These questions assess views on income equality (EQUALITY), private versus government ownership of businesses (PRIVATE), government versus personal responsibility (GOV), and views on competition (COMP).

Key findings and methodologies include:

1. **Polarization and Government Size**: The study finds a robust correlation between political polarization and the size of government. This correlation is particularly strong among government supporters compared to opposition supporters.

2. **Data and Measures**: The analysis uses data primarily from the WVS 2000 wave, with some data from 1995 to increase sample size, covering 83 countries. Responses are analyzed for dispersion using the standard deviation as the main measure of polarization, alongside Esteban and Ray's polarization measure and a bipolarization index.

3. **Impact of Government Fragmentation**: The relationship between polarization and government size is stronger in democracies with fragmented governments or legislatures, aligning with veto player theory, which suggests that diverse party opinions increase the likelihood of vetoing spending proposals.

4. **Empirical Analysis**: Table 3 lists countries with the highest and lowest political polarization, measured by the standard deviation of responses to the GOV question. Pakistan, with a standard deviation of 1.92, has the lowest polarization, while El Salvador, with a standard deviation of 3.70, has the highest.

5. **Correlations and Concerns**: The standard deviations of the economic policy questions are highly correlated at the country level, while mean responses are less correlated, addressing concerns about country-specific questions. The study notes potential issues due to responses being relative to the current size of government, which could affect polarization measures' validity.

The study concludes that while the association between polarization and government size is clear, further work is needed to establish causality and underlying mechanisms. Data nuances, such as country-specific context and the framing of questions, are acknowledged as limitations that could impact results. The full empirical results and methodology details are available in a supplementary appendix online.

The text presents a study that examines the relationship between political polarization and the size of government, specifically in terms of government consumption. The measure of government size used is government consumption as a fraction of total consumption (GOVCONS), derived from data compiled by Gwartney and Lawson (2008) using World Bank and IMF resources. To assess the robustness of these findings, the study also considers a measure of redistribution, transfers, and subsidies as a fraction of GDP (GOVTRANSSUB).

The analysis attempts to control for various factors that could affect both polarization and government size. These controls are divided into exogenous ones like geographic dummy variables and colonial origins, and potentially endogenous variables such as GDP per capita, openness to trade, demographic factors, federal structure, and OECD membership status.

The estimation strategy involves regressing government size on political polarization with a set of control variables. The paper considers three specifications: a "basic" one with minimal controls, a "short" one with geographic and colonial controls, and a "long" one including potentially endogenous variables.

Key findings from the study include:
- Higher political polarization is generally associated with smaller government sizes, particularly in strong democracies.
- In the "no controls" specification, the coefficient (\(\beta\)) for polarization is significantly negative across all polarization measures for strong democracies, indicating a robust relationship.
- For the "short" specification, polarization remains significantly negative for strong democracies, especially notable for the PRIVATE and GOV measures.
- The "long" specification also shows significantly negative coefficients for strong democracies in certain cases.
  
Political polarization seems to be more influential in democratically developed countries, and the research confirms robustness through various control checks. However, handling endogeneity and confounding factors remains a methodological challenge. The results hold even with robustness tests that manipulate sample inclusion criteria and control variable selection. The use of the Polity IV democracy index allows for the classification into strong and weak democracies, contributing to the understanding of polarization's effects on government size.

The paper examines the impact of political polarization on the size of government, specifically focusing on government consumption (GOVCONS) and redistribution measures like transfers and subsidies (GOVTRANSSUB). The study is based on data from 74 countries, evaluating how these relationships differ depending on the level of democratic development (strong vs. weak democracies).

**Methodologies and Specifications:**
1. **Regression Specifications:** Three primary specifications are tested—basic, short, and long—on three samples: all countries, weak democracies, and strong democracies.
2. **Control Variables:** Exogenous and endogenous sets of control variables are used to account for mean response and other influencing factors.
3. **Polarization Measures:** The study evaluates correlations between polarization and government consumption using different polarization metrics.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Polarization's Effect in Strong Democracies:** Political polarization has a negative and statistically significant impact on government consumption in strong democracies. An increase in polarization, measured by one standard deviation, predicts a decrease in government consumption by 4.0 percentage points and varies between 2.0 to 6.1 percentage points for other questions.
2. **Weak Democracies:** No significant relationship was found between polarization and government size in weak democracies.
3. **Democratic Development:** The significance of polarization on government size is contingent on democratic maturity, with stronger effects in robust democracies.

**Robustness Tests:**
1. **Additional Controls:** Geographic, demographic, and political factors were considered, such as mountainous terrain, population density, and regime type. Despite small sample sizes in strong democracies, the polarization effect remained significant.
2. **Income Inequality:** The potential confounding role of income inequality was acknowledged, and additional measures were incorporated to control for this.
3. **Measurement Error and Instrumental Variables:** Polarization was instrumented using previous survey waves to adjust for possible measurement errors, particularly in weak democracies, although results were imprecise due to limited observations.

**Conclusions:**
- **Causal Inferences:** The results suggest a causal effect of polarization on government size in strong democracies, though potential reverse causality (government size affecting polarization) cannot be fully dismissed.
- **Further Observations:** The relationships between polarization and government size (consumption and redistribution) remain robust to changes in model specifications and control variables.

Overall, the study establishes that political polarization can significantly influence government size in environments with mature democratic structures. The findings hold implications for understanding how political dynamics shape fiscal policies across different governmental contexts.

The document appears to be from a technical paper examining the relationship between political polarization and government consumption, specifically within the context of income inequality and political preferences. It includes a multitude of regression analyses controlling for various factors such as economic context, geographic variables, and demographic indicators.

Key methodologies include:
- Use of multiple regression models to evaluate the impact of political polarization on government consumption.
- Control variables such as the Gini coefficient for income inequality, measures of political polarization, and demographic indicators like education and income.
- Robustness checks using survey data to ensure that questions capture relevant political preferences across different countries.

Specific metrics and results:
- The paper reports coefficients and heteroscedasticity robust standard errors for several variables across different models.
- Political polarization measures are highly correlated with their income-adjusted counterparts, with correlation coefficients above 0.99.
- Adjusted R² values for the different specifications range from 0.427 to 0.669, indicating varying levels of explanatory power.
- Political polarization is negatively correlated with ideological coherence—more polarized opinions correlate with less coherence across different questions.
- In strong democracies, the coefficients for political polarization on government consumption are negative and significant in most models, particularly when focusing on government (−19.39 to −21.39, significant at the 0.01 level).
- The Gini coefficient has significant negative effects on government size in some models, indicating its role in conditioning government spending.

Conclusions:
- Political polarization tends to reduce government consumption, especially evident in strong democracies.
- Income inequality, even when adjusted for political polarization, remains a significant factor but does not greatly alter the impact of polarization on government size.
- Ideological coherence, or consistency in political preferences, correlates positively with spending but does not override the effect of political polarization.
- The study suggests that divisive policies do not primarily drive political polarization, given that polarization corresponds negatively with ideological coherence.

Overall, the paper strongly indicates that political polarization plays a substantial role in shaping government consumption patterns, influenced by both income inequality and ideological coherence factors.

The paper investigates the relationship between political polarization and the size of government, examining the potential impacts of trust in politicians and polarization within electorates and legislatures. Key methodologies include using average responses to survey questions about confidence in parliament (CONFIDENCE) and corruption levels (CORRUPTION) as proxies for politician trustworthiness, and measuring political polarization using Herfindahl indexes (HERFGOV, HERFLEG) and the number of political parties (NGOV, NLEG). The study also incorporates the concept of "false consensus" by including absolute deviations from a median value (CONSENSUS) as a control variable.

The results indicate that polarization among voters is strongly correlated with government size in democracies, though the relationship appears not to be directly mediated by polarization within legislatures or governments. Various control variables, including CONFIDENCE, CORRUPTION, and CONSENSUS, minimally affect the findings.

The study further explores measures of political polarization based on party sympathies derived from the World Values Survey (WVS), revealing that polarization among government supporters more robustly predicts government consumption than polarization among opposition supporters. However, systematic correlations between electorate polarization and legislative polarization measures (e.g., HERFGOV, LEGPOL) are relatively weak or non-significant.

Conclusively, while polarization in the electorate correlates with government spending, this influence seems not to flow directly through legislative polarization, indicating the need to consider other factors like voter preferences and party formation influences. The study sheds light on the indirect pathways through which voter polarization affects government size, emphasizing the complexity of political-economic interactions in democratic contexts.

The paper examines the relationship between political polarization and public spending, focusing on the dynamics within governments and their supporters. Here are the key methodologies, metrics, results, and conclusions:

**Methodologies:**
- The study explores theoretical mechanisms such as veto players, strategic incumbents, and two-stage voting models.
- Regression analyses were conducted, incorporating interaction terms between polarization and variables like the number of political parties in government (HERFGOV and HERFLEG) and government seat shares (GOVSEATS).
- Principal factor analysis was used to distinguish between general preferences for government size and specific types of government intervention.

**Specific Metrics:**
- Key metrics include the polarization among government and opposition supporters, the number and ideological distance of political parties, and various government structure indicators like HERFGOV, HERFLEG, NLEG, NGOV, and GOVSEATS.
- Regression coefficients (β) and interaction terms were reported with heteroscedasticity robust standard errors.

**Results:**
- Polarization among government supporters was more strongly associated with public spending changes than polarization among opposition supporters.
- The relationship between polarization and government size was stronger in countries with fragmented governments, but these interaction effects were not statistically significant across all models.
- The effect of polarization on government size was larger when the government had a higher probability of reelection, indicated by the negative interaction term with GOVSEATS.
- When controlling for property rights, the expected effect of polarization on government size was not particularly sensitive, hinting at less support for some strategic incumbent models.

**Conclusions:**
- Political polarization is a significant predictor of public spending, especially in fragmented legislative systems.
- The strategic use of debt by incumbents, as suggested by previous literature, is supported, but other mechanisms like property rights showed less influence.
- The two-stage voting model suggests that disagreement over public resource allocation can lead to lower overall spending preferences. However, due to high correlation between polarization measures and limited data, these findings should be cautiously interpreted.
- Overall, the study highlights the nuanced role of polarization in determining the size of government and suggests it has varied effects depending on government structure and strategic behavior of incumbents.

The study examines the connection between political polarization and government size, leveraging a model by Fernández and Levy (2008) which suggests a U-shaped relationship between preference heterogeneity among the poor and redistribution. However, empirical tests using measures of polarization among low-income and high-income respondents in various countries did not support this model.

The paper also explores the Meltzer and Richard (1981) model, suggesting that voter preferences dispersion can influence government size. One hypothesis is that when individuals who prefer larger governments are less likely to vote, this skews preferences towards smaller government, although empirical validation of this mechanism is weak. Another hypothesis considers voter altruism, suggesting that polarization related to attitudes beyond economic policy might affect altruism and thus public spending. However, this was not strongly supported by empirical data.

Empirical tests indicated that political polarization is negatively correlated with public spending. This relationship is particularly strong in democratic countries and robust across various control variables and measures of polarization. The study suggests a stronger relationship between polarization and government size in countries with fragmented political parties, aligning with veto player theory, which posits that more party fragmentation leads to more spending proposal vetoes.

Overall, the study finds a consistent negative correlation between political polarization and government size, particularly in democracies with fragmented party structures. The research calls for further investigation into the mechanisms behind this correlation, as current tests of theories relating to strategic government behavior, coalition formation, voter turnout, and altruism did not yield substantial support. The study acknowledges limitations due to data constraints and the interdependence of polarization measures with government size.

The document discusses research on political polarization and its impact on public spending, utilizing data from the World Values Survey (WVS). The research aims to explore whether political polarization influences variation in public spending within countries. However, establishing a causal link requires exogenous variation in political polarization without affecting government size independently—a challenging feat given the interconnected nature of political factors. The research also highlights the potential influence of media on political polarization, referencing models and empirical evidence that partisan media affects voter behavior.

For methodology, polarization is calculated using responses to party preference from WVS. Data were matched with the number of legislative seats and government/opposition status, with results limited to parties represented in the legislature. This produced standard deviations for each political party and government/opposition groups within countries. The research uses data from the most recent elections before the survey start in each country, with Beck et al. (2001) as a primary source.

The document provides detailed data tables (A1, A2) with metrics such as government transfers and subsidies as a percentage of GDP, as well as general government consumption. These metrics are compared across various countries and regions, such as Africa, Asia, Latin America, and OECD countries. Important control variables include GDP per capita, trade openness, demographic proportions, federal structures, and indices of democracy. Ethnic, linguistic, and religious fractionalization, along with trust measures, are considered. The results are contextualized with data points like the Gini index for income inequality and structural variables like presidential versus parliamentary regimes. The research concludes with suggestions for further exploration into how media and diverging policy beliefs contribute to political polarization.

The document provides an analysis of various index measures and survey questions from different sources, including the European Values Study Group and World Values Association, Transparency International, Beck et al., and others. These measures are used to assess aspects like press freedom, confidence in the government, corruption, political composition, and social values across countries for various years, notably around 2000 to 2002. 

Key indices and questions include:

1. **PFREEDOM**: A press freedom index where 0 signifies total press freedom and 100 indicates no press freedom.
2. **CONFIDENCE**: This measures public confidence in the parliament with responses from 1 (a great deal) to 4 (none at all).
3. **CORRUPTION**: Transparency International’s index rating public sector corruption from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (highly clean).
4. **HERFGOV and HERFLEG**: Herfindahl Index values representing political party concentration within government and legislature, respectively.
5. **PRIGHTS**: A measure of protection of property rights scored from 0 to 100.
6. **TURNOUT**: Voter turnout rates in elections, calculated as the percentage of registered voters who cast votes.
7. **GOD and PRIDE**: Questions about the importance of God and national pride.
8. **AUTHORITY, ABORT, HOMO**: Questions addressing views on respect for authority, the justification of abortion, and the justification of homosexuality.

For polarization measures, the text discusses alternatives such as the Esteban and Ray (1994) measure which includes a parameter (α) for sensitivity to polarization. The correlation of different polarization metrics is shown with the Esteban and Ray measure displaying varied correlation with standard deviation, depending on the value of α, which affects the distribution of responses. 

In analyzing countries like Sweden and Brazil, the standard deviation of responses and classification into polarized categories show Brazil as more polarized, suggesting that these measures can distinguish differences in public opinion on government responsibility. Various assessments of these measures are compared, showing their utility in studying political polarization and the impact on public spending. 

Overall, the document reflects an intricate study of societal attitudes and political indices to draw inferences about governance and public sentiment across nations, indicating broader implications for governance based on public opinion polarization.

The document appears to be a compilation of references from various studies, articles, and dissertations related to political science and economics, touching on subjects like political polarization, media influence, electoral systems, social identity, redistribution, and the size of government. Key methodologies include comparative analyses and empirical research. The document lists influential works on topics such as the effects of media bias on voting (DellaVigna and Kaplan, 2007), the measurement of polarization (Esteban and Ray, 1994), and political instability and its economic impacts (Cukierman et al., 1992).

Specific metrics and results are found in individual studies like Frye (2002) discussing economic performance in post-communist societies, indicating the perils of polarization, and Gerber and Lewis (2004) exploring voter preferences and district heterogeneity.

Conclusions from these works collectively emphasize the interconnection between political structures and economic outcomes, demonstrate the role of media in shaping political opinions, and illustrate varying patterns of government redistribution based on institutional design and public preferences.

Overall, the document serves as a comprehensive resource for research on political and economic phenomena, summarizing foundational theories, and offering quantitative insights into complex socio-political topics.

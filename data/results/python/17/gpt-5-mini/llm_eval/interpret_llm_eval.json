  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The summary provides a detailed narrative of the replication process, including the execution environment and the main deviation from the preregistration (not applying the strong democracy subset). However, it lacks some specific details about the original study's hypothesis and results, which are crucial for a complete interpretation."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The execution status is correctly identified as 'Partial Success' due to the failure to apply the preregistered sample restriction. However, the explanation could be more detailed regarding the specific steps that were successful and those that were not."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The method alignment is mostly similar to the reference. It correctly identifies the use of OLS with robust SEs and the alignment with the 'long' specification. However, it does not mention the specific control variables used, which are part of the original specification."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].issue_description": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The issue description is an exact match with the reference, clearly stating the failure to subset the data to strong democracies as specified in the preregistration."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].impact": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The impact assessment is an exact match, accurately describing the high impact of not applying the sample restriction on the validity of the numeric comparisons."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The issue description is mostly similar, mentioning the existence of a script for strong-democracy analysis that was not executed. However, it lacks specific details about the script's content or purpose."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact assessment is mostly similar, correctly identifying the medium impact and suggesting a targeted rerun. However, it could be more specific about the consequences of not executing the script."
  },
  "results_comparison.hypothesis_tested": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis tested is an exact match with the reference, accurately restating the focal hypothesis about the negative association between polarization and government consumption among strong democracies."
  },
  "results_comparison.original_results": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The original results are an exact match, providing the same coefficient, standard error, and p-value as the reference for the strong-democracy subset."
  },
  "results_comparison.replication_results": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The replication results are an exact match, accurately reporting the coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and sample sizes for both the full sample and the drop-wave-7 variant."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The overall answer is an exact match, correctly stating that the replication does not satisfy the preregistered comparison criteria due to the failure to apply the sample restriction."
  },
  "replication_report": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The replication report is mostly similar, summarizing the main findings and deviations. However, it could be more concise and focused on the key outcomes and implications of the replication attempt."
  },
  "failure_handling[0].failure_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The failure type is an exact match, correctly identifying the method/alignment failure due to not applying the sample restriction."
  },
  "failure_handling[0].suggestions": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The suggestions are an exact match, providing clear and actionable recommendations to rerun the analysis with the correct sample restriction."
  },
  "failure_handling[1].failure_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The failure type is an exact match, correctly identifying the data-related failure concerning the variable sd_gov and sample size verification."
  },
  "failure_handling[1].suggestions": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The suggestions are an exact match, providing specific steps to verify the data and ensure consistency with the original study."
  },
  "notes": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The notes are an exact match, clearly outlining the key caveats and additional checks needed for a complete replication, including sensitivity to sample size and data processing steps."

        "explanation": "This dataset contains the exact country-level variables needed to run the paper's 'long' specification (gov_consumption outcome and sd_gov main independent variable), plus the explicit Polity-like democracy score 'democ' to select strong democracies. Therefore it is qualified: it operationalizes the focal independent variable (sd_gov) and outcome (gov_consumption) and contains the control variables used in the long specification.",

The replication data contains 'sd_gov' and 'gov_consumption' and the listed controls (e.g., log_gdp_per_capita, trade_share, age_15_64, age_65_plus, regional dummies and colonial dummies), matching the operationalization described in post_registration.json. The focal claim text in initial_details.txt explicitly mentions the long specification coefficient for the 'Private' measure and strong democracies; the provided data contains 'sd_gov' and 'democ' to reproduce that restriction (initial_details.txt and post_registration.json).",
        "deviation_from_original": "The replication data is a packaged version for this replication exercise and may be a processed subset or a re-constructed merge of WVS and macro sources (post_registration.json notes the original used WVS 2000 and sometimes 1995 waves). The provided CSV appears to be a specific cross-section (year column present, and wave column). post_registration.json states original analyses used ~74-83 countries in some specs; here the provided file contains 31 rows (get_dataset_shape). Therefore this dataset is a smaller sample than some original specifications (post_registration.json results mention ~74-83 countries). This is an explicit deviation: smaller sample size and likely different wave selection and preprocessing choices. (Sources: data file inspection; post_registration.json data.notes and initial_details.txt for the focal claim.)"

Possible caveats: small sample (31 rows) relative to the original paper's larger country samples; column 'democ' appears to be the democracy score used to subset (Polity-like), but confirm coding (higher values indicate more democratic; initial_details.txt specifies Polity IV >= 9). No explicit codebook in the bundle; users should verify variable coding if replicating with the original raw data sources. The R script originally read 'output/data.csv' but the provided CSV is at replication_data/data.csv; I translated and placed Python scripts to operate on the provided path under /app/data per instructions."

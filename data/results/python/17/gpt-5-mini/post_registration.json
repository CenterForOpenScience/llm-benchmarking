      "description": "The study constructs country-level measures of political polarization from individual World Values Survey responses to economic policy questions (EQUALITY, PRIVATE, GOV, COMP), primarily using the standard deviation as the main polarization metric (alongside Esteban-Ray and bipolarization measures). These polarization measures are merged with country-level fiscal outcomes (government consumption as fraction of total consumption; transfers/subsidies as fraction of GDP) and other control variables. The paper estimates OLS regressions of government size on polarization under three specifications (basic, short, long) and splits the sample by level of democratic development (Polity IV index into strong vs. weak democracies). Robustness checks include alternative polarization measures, additional controls, interaction terms with legislative fragmentation and government seat shares, and instrumental variables using previous survey waves.",

      "summary": "The study finds a robust negative correlation between political polarization and government size, particularly in well-developed (strong) democracies. In strong democracies, higher voter polarization is associated with lower government consumption; this relationship is robust across many specifications and polarization metrics. No consistent negative relationship is found in weak democracies. Results are robust to several control sets and alternative measures, though IV estimates are imprecise in some cases. Interaction tests suggest stronger relationships when governments are more fragmented, consistent with veto-player logic, but interaction coefficients are not uniformly significant. The paper does not definitively establish causal mechanisms.",

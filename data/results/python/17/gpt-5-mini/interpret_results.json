  "interpretation_summary": "I inspected the preregistered focal claim (negative effect of polarization, sd_gov, on gov_consumption among strong democracies) and ran through the executed replication artifacts. The analysis code executed successfully in a Docker environment and produced regression outputs for the provided dataset. The executed specification matched the paper's covariates and used OLS with heteroskedasticity-robust SEs (HC1), but it did not apply the preregistered subset to strong democracies (democ >= 9). Because the original focal result was reported for the strong-democracy subset, the produced full-sample estimates are not directly comparable to the original claim. Numerically, the replication\u2019s full-sample point estimates for sd_gov are small and negative (-2.57 and -2.91) and statistically non-significant (p \u2248 0.42\u20130.43), which does not reproduce the original reported strong, significant effect (coefficient = -18.73, SE = 4.79, p = 0.01) for strong democracies.",

  "notes": "Key caveat: the replication's current outputs are not comparable to the published focal result because the sample restriction is missing. The dataset is small (\u2248 28\u201331 observations in the reported outputs), so estimates are sensitive to sample inclusion/exclusion and small coding differences. After re-running the model on the strong-democracy subset, also check robust SE method (HC1 used here) and any other minor data processing steps (e.g., whether original authors scaled sd_gov or used an alternative polarization operationalization). If the strong-democracy rerun still fails to reproduce the magnitude/significance, examine variable mapping, transformations, and potential errors in the original or replication data preparation."

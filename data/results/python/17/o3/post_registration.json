      "summary": "Across 74 countries, higher electorate polarization is strongly associated with smaller government consumption, but only in strong democracies. In weak or non-democracies the association is negligible. A one-standard-deviation increase in polarization predicts roughly a 4-percentage-point reduction in government consumption in strong democracies. Findings are robust to numerous controls, alternative polarization metrics, and alternative spending measures.",

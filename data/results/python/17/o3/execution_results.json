An initial run failed because statsmodels detected NaNs in the regressors. The script was patched to drop rows with missing data, after which it produced four result files. The focal replication result (real_drop_7.csv) indicates a negative but statistically non-significant association between economic-policy polarization (sd_gov) and government consumption, contrary to the original significant negative finding.",

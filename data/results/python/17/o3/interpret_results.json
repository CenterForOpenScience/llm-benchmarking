  "interpretation_summary": "The replication successfully executed after a minor code fix (dropping rows with missing data). The preregistered OLS model was run twice (excluding and including Wave-7 countries). In both specifications the coefficient on economic-policy polarization (sd_gov) remained negative \u2013 matching the theoretical direction \u2013 but was far smaller in magnitude (\u2248 \u22122.9 vs. the original \u221218.7) and statistically non-significant (p\u22480.40). Hence the replication, based on a newer and much smaller cross-section of strong democracies, does not reproduce the original paper\u2019s large, significant negative relationship between polarization and government size.",

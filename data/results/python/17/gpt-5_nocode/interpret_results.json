  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed the preregistered OLS with HC1 robust SEs on the strong-democracy subsample (democ >= 9), regressing government consumption on a WVS-based polarization metric (sd_gov) with long-spec controls. The coefficient on polarization was negative as hypothesized but statistically insignificant and much smaller in magnitude than the original study\u2019s reported effects. High alignment with the planned method was achieved, though the replication necessarily deviated in the polarization measure (GOV vs. PRIVATE) and used a smaller, cross-sectional sample (N=30). Diagnostics indicated potential multicollinearity and overparameterization from many dummies relative to sample size, likely inflating SEs. Overall, the replication did not reproduce the original paper\u2019s significant negative association.",

  "notes": "Power is limited with N=30 and many controls; the large condition number and constraint-rank warning suggest multicollinearity that likely inflates SEs. The single-year cross-section may not capture cross-wave stability exploited by the original. Consider sensitivity analyses: alternative polarization measures (PRIVATE, Esteban-Ray), alternative outcomes (transfers/subsidies), reduced-control models, and influence diagnostics. Results remain correlational; endogeneity concerns from the original context also apply."

    Replication of a research claim from Lindqvist and Östling (2010)
in American Political Science Review
Levi Boxell, Stanford University
Tuesday 17th November, 2020
Project ID: LINDQVIST_AmPoliSciRev_2010_OeGv - Boxell - Direct Replication - y050
OSF Project: https://osf.io/8pxty
Preregistration: https://osf.io/2urdw
Claim Summary: The claim selected for replication from Lindqvist & Östling (2010) is that the correlation be-
tween polarization and government size is signiﬁcantly stronger among democratic countries; the association between
polarization and government size in strong democracies is the speciﬁc part of the ﬁnding selected for the SCORE
program. This reﬂects the following statement from the paper’s abstract: “Political polarization is strongly associated
with smaller government in democratic countries, but there is no relationship between polarization and the size of
government in undemocratic countries.” The analysis relies on a regression of government size (general government
consumption as a fraction of total consumption, averaged from 2003-2005) on the standard deviation of four World
Values Survey items measuring various economic aspects of left and right on a 1-10 scale, in four separate models.
The authors estimate a regression for each of these measures in the paper; the SCORE program has selected the 1-10
scale where 1 means complete agreement that “Private ownership of business should be increased” and 10 means
complete agreement that “Government ownership of business and industry should be increased.” In the ‘long’ speci-
ﬁcation chosen for the SCORE program, the authors control for the mean value of responses, along with geographic
and colonial controls, and an additional set of potentially endogenous control variables. The authors split their sample
such that countries with a Polity IV democracy score of 9 to 10 are strong democracies, while countries with scores 0
to 8 are weak democracies. The evidence selected for the SCORE program is the regression estimated on the strong
democratic sample using the measure of polarization speciﬁed above (results are signiﬁcant using three of the four
measures in the paper with this speciﬁcation).
Replication Criteria: Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project is a statistically signiﬁcant
effect (alpha = .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal hypothesis test (H*). For this
study, this criteria is met by a negative and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient on the term for polarization in the focal regression
model.
Replication Results:
• Waves 5 and 6 Only (28 observations): The replication included 28 countries in the analytic sample, which
is just short of the desired sample size for stage 1 data collection (n = 30). There was no signiﬁcant effect
of the standard deviation of responses to the question on government ownership (i.e., polarization) on average
government consumption as a fraction of total consumption between 2010–2014 (coefﬁcient: -2.91; standard
error: 3.45; p-value: 0.42, two-tailed). Thus, this replication of the claim was unsuccessful according to the
SCORE criteria.
• Waves 5, 6, and 7 (30 observations): The replication included 30 countries in the analytic sample, which
acheives the desired sample size for stage 1 data collection (n = 30). There was no signiﬁcant effect of the stan-
dard deviation of responses to the question on government ownership (i.e., polarization) on average government
consumption as a fraction of total consumption between 2010–2014 (coefﬁcient: -2.57; standard error: 3.15;
p-value: 0.43, two-tailed). Thus, this replication of the claim was unsuccessful according to the SCORE criteria.

Deviations from Preregistration: In order to achieve a desired sample size of 30 observations, we obtained supple-
mentary data for Trinidad and Tobago that was not originally included in the preregistration. Speciﬁcally, we computed
the 2010 trade share of GDP (112.2845) using data from https://oec.world/en/proﬁle/country/tto and
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD?locations=TT, and we computed the average ‘General gov-
ernment ﬁnal consumption expenditure’ as a share of total GDP between 2010 and 2014 (10.1) using data from
https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/CountryProﬁle.
Also, the Polity5 series was used instead of the Polity IV version for democracy scores.

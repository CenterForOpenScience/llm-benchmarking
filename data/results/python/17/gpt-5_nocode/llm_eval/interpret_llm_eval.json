  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The interpretation summary accurately describes the replication process, including the use of OLS with HC1 robust SEs, the subsample of strong democracies, and the deviations in the polarization measure and sample size. It also correctly notes the diagnostics and the overall outcome of the replication not reproducing the original paper's significant negative association."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The execution status is marked as 'Success,' which aligns with the completion of the replication process as described in the reference document."

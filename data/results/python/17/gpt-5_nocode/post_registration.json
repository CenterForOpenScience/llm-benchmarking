Alternative measures include Esteban-Ray polarization and a bipolarization index; an income-adjusted polarization measure is highly correlated (>0.99) with the unadjusted version. Stability across WVS waves: correlation 0.72\u20130.81. Government size measured as government consumption (GOVCONS) and transfers and subsidies (GOVTRANSSUB), typically as shares of consumption or GDP. Countries are split by democracy strength using Polity IV. Additional controls include GDP per capita, trade openness, demographics, federal structure, OECD membership, income inequality, social trust, ideological coherence, press freedom, corruption, and confidence in parliament."

It estimates the association separately for weak and strong democracies (Polity IV), examines robustness to multiple control sets, employs alternative polarization metrics, and explores mechanisms via legislative/government fragmentation and supporter subgroup polarization.",

      "summary": "Across countries, higher political polarization is associated with smaller government size, especially in strong democracies. The negative relationship is robust across control specifications and alternative polarization measures. Effects are negligible and statistically insignificant in weak democracies. In strong democracies, polarization is also linked to lower transfers and subsidies. Polarization among government supporters is more predictive of spending than polarization among opposition supporters. Legislative/government fragmentation tends to amplify the relationship, though most interaction terms are not individually significant. A one standard deviation increase in polarization predicts about a 4 percentage point decrease in government consumption.",

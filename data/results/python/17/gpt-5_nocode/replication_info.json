        "similarity_to_original": "The original study constructs polarization from WVS economic policy questions and relates it to government size with controls (post_registration.json; original_paper.pdf summary). The provided dataset includes sd_gov (a WVS-based dispersion measure), gov_consumption, Polity IV democracy measure (democ), and key controls such as log_gdp_per_capita, trade_share, federal, oecd, region and colonial dummies, and demographics (replication_data/data.csv columns). These align with the original study\u2019s core variables and control strategy (post_registration.json method and results; original_paper.pdf summary).",
        "deviation_from_original": "The initial_details.txt highlights a focal coefficient for the 'Private' polarization measure (-18.73 in the long specification), whereas our dataset exposes sd_gov (GOV question) but not sd_private. Therefore, we replicate the core relationship using the GOV polarization metric instead of the PRIVATE metric. Additionally, the original includes ~83 countries across multiple waves and additional variables, while this dataset contains 31 countries, predominantly for year=2010 with waves 5\u20137 (post_registration.json vs. replication_data/data.csv). The paper also reports a GOV-based long-spec coefficient around -19.56 in strong democracies (original_paper.pdf summary), which better matches our operationalization."

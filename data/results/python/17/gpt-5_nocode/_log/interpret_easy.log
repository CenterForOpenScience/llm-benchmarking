[CLAIM]
Political polarization is strongly associatedwith smaller government in democratic countries, but there is no relationship between polarization and the size ofgovernment in undemocratic countries. When the sample is restricted to strong democracies, the estimated effect of polarization on government consumption is statistically significant (coefficient in the ‘long’ specification for the “Private” measure of polarization=-18.73, heteroscedasticity robust SE=4.79, p=.01)

[HYPOTHESIS]
Among strong democracies (countries with a Polity IV score of 9 or greater), polarization (as measured by the SD of the “private ownership” responses) will be negatively associated with the size of government

The replication followed the planned OLS with HC1 SEs on strong democracies (democ >= 9), using sd_gov as the polarization measure due to data availability, with long-spec controls.

High alignment with the planned method was achieved, though the replication necessarily deviated in the polarization measure (GOV vs. PRIVATE) and used a smaller, cross-sectional sample (N=30).

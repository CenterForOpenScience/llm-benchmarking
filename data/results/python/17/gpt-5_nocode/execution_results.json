Initial Docker build failed due to shell parsing of version constraints; resolved by pinning Python package versions in replication_info.json, regenerating the Dockerfile, and rebuilding. The analysis ran successfully and saved outputs. The focal hypothesis (negative association between sd_gov and gov_consumption) was tested; the estimated coefficient was negative but not statistically significant in this dataset.",

The replication_analysis.py script was executed inside the container after editing to drop rows with missing regressors, resolving a MissingDataError. The analysis followed preregistered steps: preprocessing COVID-19 dataset, computing country-level growth coefficients, constructing interaction term (eff_tight) and running HC3-robust OLS. The focal interaction coefficient is negative but not statistically significant (p = 0.369), thus not supporting the original claim.",

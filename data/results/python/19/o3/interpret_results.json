  "interpretation_summary": "The preregistered Python script reproduced the planned workflow: it computed country-specific COVID-19 growth coefficients for the first 30 days after reaching 1 case / million, merged them with cultural tightness and government efficiency, and estimated an HC3-robust OLS with their interaction. Execution completed without errors after a minor code edit (dropping rows with remaining missing values). The resulting interaction (tightness \u00d7 efficiency) remained negative but was small and statistically non-significant (p = 0.37). Thus, on the reduced 57-country sample and alternative outcome definition, the replication did not support the original claim of a sizeable, significant negative interaction.",

The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

The preprint examines how cultural and institutional factors predict the infection rate and mortality likelihood during the COVID-19 pandemic, using data from 528,019 confirmed cases across 141 countries. It proposes that nations with efficient governments and tight cultures—characterized by strong norms and low tolerance for deviance—are more successful at curbing COVID-19’s spread and mortality. 

Key methodological details include using the World Bank’s Government Efficiency Index and a cultural tightness index by Gelfand et al., to measure institutional efficiency and cultural norms, respectively. Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths were sourced from the European Center for Disease Control, and adjusted to cases per million to control for population size.

The study applied regression analyses, log-transforming both cases per million and days to capture exponential growth rates. Models controlled for economic development (GDP per capita), inequality (Gini coefficients), and median age. Infection rates were analyzed using ordinary least squares regression with a Gaussian distribution, while mortality likelihood used a logistic function with an exponential distribution due to skewness in data.

Results showed that both cultural tightness and government efficiency significantly predict slower growth in COVID-19 cases. Specifically, culturally tight nations and those with efficient governments exhibited slower infection rates (p < .05 for cultural tightness; p = .006 for government efficiency). These findings were illustrated in model coefficients displayed in Table 1, which included other predictors such as GDP per capita, yielding significant predictors of COVID-19 spread dynamics.

The conclusion emphasizes the combination of tight cultures and government efficiency as critical to managing COVID-19. This suggests policy implications for enhancing institutional efficiency and fostering cooperative norms in managing public health crises. The study's data and code are made available for further analysis and replication, ensuring transparency of the research findings.

The study analyzed the interaction between cultural tightness and government efficiency on the growth rates of COVID-19, revealing significant findings. Key methodologies included regression analysis to assess the interaction effect, using metrics such as cultural tightness, government efficiency, and exponential growth rates of COVID-19 cases and mortality.

Results showed that cultural tightness significantly predicted slower rates of COVID-19 cases among governments with high efficiency (b = -.19, SE = .08, p = .028) but not with low efficiency. Government efficiency predicted slower rates for nations with high cultural tightness (b = -.36, SE = .16, p = .024) but not for those with low tightness. In nations with high cultural tightness and government efficiency, the log-transformed rate of COVID-19 cases was lower (1.06) compared to those with mean levels (1.41) or both low tightness and efficiency (1.45). When converted back, this indicated 103.21 fewer cases per million people in a month for tight and efficient nations.

For mortality likelihood, logistic regression highlighted that both cultural tightness and government efficiency corresponded with lower death rates, with a significant interaction (b = -0.30, SE = .03, p < .001). High tightness and efficiency resulted in a mortality likelihood of 1.48%, compared to 2.91% in low tightness and efficiency nations, translating to 467.90 fewer deaths per month in a U.S.-sized population.

An evolutionary game theory model further illustrated that in environments with escalating threats, such as COVID-19, tight cultures (higher probability of cooperation) showed greater survival rates compared to loose cultures. This model implied that in such threats, rapid adoption and dissemination of cooperative norms are critical, particularly in efficient governments.

The study concludes that a combination of cultural and institutional factors influences national responses to pandemics. Nations with strict norms and efficient governance are better poised to implement and ensure compliance with cooperative norms critical for survival during global threats. The findings suggest that loose cultures like Spain and the U.S. should focus on enhancing compliance with norms to effectively combat the pandemic.

The paper investigates the impact of cultural tightness and government efficiency on the spread and mortality of COVID-19, utilizing a blend of empirical analysis, evolutionary game theory (EGT) modeling, and covariate control (e.g., societal wealth, inequality, average age). Key methodologies include the use of longitudinal data, controlling for GDP per capita and population density, and constructing a 20x20 toroidal grid for EGT simulations. The study finds that both cultural tightness (b = -0.14, p = 0.048) and government efficiency (b = -0.20, p = 0.003) are significant predictors of infection rate, with their interaction also significant (b = -0.15, p = 0.031).

The experiment simulates agents on this grid, alternating between cooperation and defection strategies in response to ecological threats (τ) and conformity rates (c), reflecting environmental payoff structures. Results indicate that moderate-to-severe threats increase agents' cooperation and survival in tight cultures.

Key conclusions suggest tight cultures may better control the virus initially, while loose cultures might innovate long-term strategies. Thus, strong norms and effective leadership could save lives, but authoritarian measures risk harming citizen well-being. The study identifies GDP as a significant factor while population density is not, contrary to expectations. The models confirm that conforming pressures (c) play a crucial role, as exemplified by the variance in agent behavior under tight conditions. These findings underscore the importance of balancing norm enforcement with creativity in pandemic responses.

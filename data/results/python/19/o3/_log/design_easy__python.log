[CLAIM]
Nations with efficient governments and tight cultures have been most effectiveat limiting COVID-19’s infection rate and mortality likelihood (a significant interaction betweentightness and efficiency, b = -.17, SE = .07, t(41) = -2.23, p = .031).

[HYPOTHESIS]
The interaction between cultural tightness and government efficiency will be negative in its association with the COVID-19 infection rate.

FROM THE DATA FINDER, SECTION 12B

The discrepancy between 57 countries in the preprint and 63 countries in the csv 
is likely accounted for by the exclusion of 6 countries that the corresponding 
author noted via email: Belgium, France, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, and Venezuela. 

For these six countries, the data collection that produced the tightness measure 
was conducted earlier than for the rest of the countries. The corresponding author 
recommended excluding the six countries from the replication attempt, as they 
did in the original analysis.

--- PDF SUMMARY (Document was 22 pages long) ---
The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

The draft manuscript investigates how cultural and institutional factors influence the COVID-19 infection rates and mortality likelihood across 141 nations. It builds on the premise that government efficiency and cultural tightness can significantly affect virus containment. Efficient governments, capable of rapid cooperation and coordination, alongside tight cultures with strong social norms and low tolerance for deviance, are posited to have better outcomes in curbing the pandemic.

Key methodologies and metrics include:

- Data from the European Center for Disease Control was used alongside other metrics such as the World Bank’s Government Efficiency Index and a cultural tightness index.
- The study analyzed 528,019 confirmed cases and 23,672 deaths, focusing on cases per million people and mortality rates to account for population size variations.
- Infection rates were assessed through log-transformed regression models to adjust for exponential growth, with days post one case per million citizens considered as a starting point for growth rate evaluation.
- Government efficiency and cultural tightness were main predictors, while controlling for GDP per capita, Gini coefficients, and median age.

Results and conclusions indicate:

- Both cultural tightness and government efficiency significantly reduce COVID-19 infection rates. Nations with tighter cultures and efficient governments exhibit slower infection growth.
- From the regression analysis (Table 1), cultural tightness negatively correlated with infection rates (b = -0.15, p = .037) while government efficiency also showed a significant negative relationship (b = -0.19, p = .006).
- Economic development (GDP per capita) positively correlated with infection rates, suggesting more developed countries recorded higher rates potentially due to better testing capabilities.

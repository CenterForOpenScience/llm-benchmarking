You are an information verifier. The task you're concerned with is extracting important information about a main claim in a research paper.
You are given TWO json objects: one extracted and one reference, your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the extraced JSON object based on the (key, value pair) presented in the reference JSON object.

=== END OF EXPLANATION OF WHAT EACH FIELD IN THE JSON MEAN ===

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The extracted information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the paper. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelated information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The extracted information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The extracted information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely. 

For fields where the reference is "not stated" or "NA", assign a score of 3 as long as the extracted information reflect similar meaning: "not available", "not stated", etc.

            "notes": "The authors downloaded data on cases per million citizens, and indexed death rate through the number of mortalities divided by the number of total cases. According to the government efficiency metric, efficient governments score highly on 5 dimensions: they are efficient in spending public revenue, they do not place strong compliance burdens on the private sector, they are able to efficiently settle legal and judicial disputes in the private sector, they are receptive to challenges from the private sector, and they offer transparent information about changes in government policies and regulations affecting private sector 5 activities. The mortality likelihood was measured through the number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by the number of COVID-19 cases in a nation. Economic development was indexed through GDP per capita, Inequality was indexed through the nations’ Gini coefficients."

Calculate the infection rate per million citizens for each day.\n3. Capture infection rate by fitting regression equations for each nation, log-transforming the outcome variable (cases per million people) and the predictor variable (days) to account for the exponential growth rate of the virus.\n4. Get government efficiency and cultural tightness data.\n5. Combine nation-level growth rate estimates with government efficiency and cultural tightness scores.\n6. Add and standardize control variables.\n7. Examine the distribution of the rate of cases and mortality likelihood before fitting the models like the authors did. They discovered that the growth rate of cases was normally distributed, but the mortality likelihood was highly skewed. If the distribution is similar, proceed to steps 8 and 9. If not, choose a model that better fits the data’s distributional characteristics.\n8. Conduct weighted ordinary least squares regression predicting log-transformed COVID-19 infection rate per million, including both main effects of cultural tightness and government efficiency and their interaction.\n9. Weight each nation’s observation by the number of days of data available to account for reliability.",

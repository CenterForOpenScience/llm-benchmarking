Models included exponential growth modeling for infection rates, regression analyses with interactions, and generalized linear models/logistic regression for mortality. The paper also discusses evolutionary game theory and agent-based simulations to contextualize dynamics of norms and virus spread.",

Each unit increase in cultural tightness and government efficiency was associated with negative coefficients for infection growth. Predicted outcomes indicated substantially fewer cases per million under high tightness and efficiency, and markedly lower mortality percentages compared to low tightness and efficiency nations.",

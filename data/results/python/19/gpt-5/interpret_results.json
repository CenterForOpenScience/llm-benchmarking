Execution completed and outputs were saved. The focal interaction was negative as hypothesized but not statistically significant (coef = -0.0259, SE = 0.0169, t(48) = -1.53, p = 0.132, 95% CI [-0.060, 0.008]). This attenuates the original reported negative interaction (e.g., b \u2248 -0.14 to -0.17, p \u2248 0.03\u20130.05) and fails to meet the preregistered significance criterion. The model showed R-squared = 0.528 (Adj R-squared = 0.469) with N = 55, and a large condition number (~4.86e5) suggesting multicollinearity among efficiency, tightness, and their interaction that may inflate standard errors. Temporal sampling differences (first-30-days window vs original fixed calendar window) and unweighted OLS may also contribute to the discrepancy.",

Results are directionally consistent but not statistically significant; sensitivity analyses (centering, robust SEs, weighting, temporal window alignment) are recommended to clarify whether insignificance stems from design choices or lack of effect."

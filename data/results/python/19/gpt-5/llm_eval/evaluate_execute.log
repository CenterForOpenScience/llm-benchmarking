You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

Created Python translations of the Stata .do pipeline (analysis_py.py and utils_py.py). Started a container and previewed the run command. After human approval, executed the analysis. The initial run failed due to a dataset path mismatch inside the container; we fixed this by adding a path resolver to search multiple plausible locations. The analysis then completed successfully: per-country exponential growth rates were computed using OLS of log(total cases per million) on time for the first 30 days after crossing 1 case/million, excluding the six countries per author guidance. The final country-level OLS tested the interaction between government efficiency and cultural tightness. The interaction coefficient was negative but not statistically significant at alpha=0.05.

Thought: I now have the necessary information from both the design and execution stages to complete the evaluation rubric. I will assess each criterion based on the information extracted from `replication_info.json` and `execution_results.json`.

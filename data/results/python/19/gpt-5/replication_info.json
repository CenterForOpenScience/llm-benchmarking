        "explanation": "The dataset contains daily COVID-19 metrics by country with cultural tightness and government efficiency measures, enabling construction of infection growth rates and testing the interaction effect. It provides a distinct sampling frame from the original fixed calendar window by focusing on the first 30 days post-threshold per country, thereby serving as a close replication with a different temporal slice yet same constructs.",
        "similarity_to_original": "The original study used ECDC cases/deaths with cultural tightness and World Bank Government Efficiency (post_registration.json: original_study.data.source; wave March 21\u201330, 2020). The provided dataset mirrors these constructs (Analysis_script_v2.do imports gelfand_replication_data.csv and references variables: total_covid_per_million, tightness, efficiency, GDP, Gini, median_age). The analysis estimates exponential growth via log(total cases per million) regressed on time, matching the original modeling approach (post_registration.json.method.models).",
        "deviation_from_original": "Original window was March 21\u201330, 2020 (post_registration.json.original_study.data.wave_or_subset). The replication computes country-specific growth over the first 30 days after surpassing 1 case per million (Analysis_script_v2.do: keep if total_covid_per_million > 1; by country: time=_n; drop if time>30), thus using a different temporal subset. The script excludes 6 countries per author note (Analysis_script_v2.do comment block), aligning to 57 countries; this differs from the CSV\u2019s initial 63 and also may differ from the original preprint\u2019s 57 via explicit justification. Degrees of freedom may differ from the published model because of this construction."

The .do fills missing early dates with tsfill and carries forward totals for zero-case days. The growth coefficient per country is obtained from OLS of log(total cases per million) on time during the first 30 days above the threshold. Final regression uses coeffs1 ~ eff_tight + gdp + gini + median_age + efficiency + tightness, where eff_tight = efficiency * tightness, and gini is constructed by replacing gini_val with alternative_gini when missing.

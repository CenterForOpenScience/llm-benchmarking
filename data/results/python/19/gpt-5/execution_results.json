  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10-slim Docker image with pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, and dateutil. Created Python translations of the Stata .do pipeline (analysis_py.py and utils_py.py). Started a container and previewed the run command. After human approval, executed the analysis. The initial run failed due to a dataset path mismatch inside the container; we fixed this by adding a path resolver to search multiple plausible locations. The analysis then completed successfully: per-country exponential growth rates were computed using OLS of log(total cases per million) on time for the first 30 days after crossing 1 case/million, excluding the six countries per author guidance. The final country-level OLS tested the interaction between government efficiency and cultural tightness. The interaction coefficient was negative but not statistically significant at alpha=0.05. Outputs were saved to /app/data.",

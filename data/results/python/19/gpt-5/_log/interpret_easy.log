**Title:** Cultural and Institutional Factors Predicting Infection Rate and Mortality Likelihood of the COVID-19 Pandemic

**Authors:** Michele J. Gelfand, Joshua Conrad Jackson, Xinyue Pan, Dana Nau, Munqith Dagher, CY Chiu

**Institutions:** University of Maryland, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Al Mustakilla Research Group, Chinese University of Hong Kong.

**Abstract Summary:**
This manuscript explores how cultural and institutional factors influence COVID-19 infection rates and mortality likelihood across countries. The findings suggest that nations with effective governments and tighter cultural norms have successfully reduced the spread and mortality rates associated with COVID-19. An evolutionary game theory model proposes that adherence to cooperative societal norms is pivotal in this context.

**Methodologies:**
1. **Data Collection:** Analysis is based on data from 528,019 confirmed COVID-19 cases (23,672 deaths) across 141 nations, collected between March 21 and March 30, 2020. 
2. **Metrics Used:**
   - **COVID-19 Infection Rate:** Cases per million citizens.
   - **Mortality Likelihood:** Ratio of deaths to total cases.
   - **Government Efficiency Index:** A World Bank measure assessing public sector efficiency in 126 nations.
   - **Cultural Tightness Index:** Developed by Gelfand et al., this measures societal norms and tolerance for deviance, collected from 57 nations.
   - **Controls Included:** GDP per capita (2019), Gini coefficients (latest from World Bank), median age (2018 CIA World Factbook).
3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - **Growth Rates:** Log-transforming cases per million and days to model exponential growth rates in ordinary least squares regression.
   - **Mortality Likelihood Model:** Logistic regression with an exponential distribution.
   - **Weighting Observations:** Regresion analysis was weighted based on the number of observations to account for reliability.

**Results:**
- Cultures that are tighter (stronger norms) and nations with more efficient governments showed significantly lower COVID-19 growth rates.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Cultural Tightness Coefficient: -0.15 (p=0.037)
  - Government Efficiency Coefficient: -0.19 (p=0.006)
  - Positive relationship with GDP: GDP per capita showed coefficients of 0.25 and 0.38 across models, indicating economic development correlates with slower infection rates.
- The analysis controlled for variables like inequality (Gini) and median age, which had minimal impact (median age p=0.852).

**Conclusions:**
Nations possessing a combination of efficient governance and cultural tightness were more effective at mitigating the COVID-19 crisis. This highlights the importance of institutional and cultural frameworks in public health responses. The study underscores the necessity for global cooperation and adherence to norms tailored toward crisis management and public health compliance. 

**Data Availability:** All associated data and code are publicly available to facilitate reproduction of the study. 

This manuscript is presented as a preprint and is subject to future modifications before official publication.

The study examined how cultural tightness and government efficiency interacted to influence COVID-19 growth rates and mortality rates across nations. The primary methodologies included regression analyses to assess the relationships between cultural tightness, government efficiency, and COVID-19-related metrics.

### Key Methodologies
1. **Regression Analyses**: Used to assess the impacts of cultural tightness and government efficiency on infection rates and mortality likelihood associated with COVID-19.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Specifically applied for mortality likelihood analysis, accounting for the time since the first confirmed case.
3. **Evolutionary Game Theory Model**: Simulated cooperation dynamics in populations with varying levels of cultural tightness under escalating threats, represented in a 20 x 20 grid with prisoner’s dilemma scenarios.

### Specific Metrics
- **Infection Rates**: Nations with high cultural tightness and high government efficiency had a lower log-transformed rate of 1.06 new cases per million compared to 1.45 for those with low metrics in both areas.
- **Estimated Cases Reduction**: A tight nation with high efficiency could have 103.21 fewer cases per million than a loose, inefficient nation over 30 days, equating to approximately 33,770 fewer cases for the United States.
- **Mortality Likelihood**: 
  - Nations with low cultural tightness and efficiency: 2.91% (95% CI = [2.64, 3.21])
  - Moderate cultural tightness and efficiency: 2.72% (95% CI = [2.58, 2.86])
  - High cultural tightness and efficiency: 1.48% (95% CI = [1.39, 1.58])
  - Estimated deaths in the U.S. for loose/inefficient cultures amounted to approximately 467.90 deaths, accounting for 14.7% of total deaths in March 2020.

### Results
- A significant interaction (b = -0.30, p < .001) was observed, indicating that nations exhibiting both high efficiency and cultural tightness had significantly lower infection and death rates.
- The evolutionary model illustrated that tight cultures exhibited enhanced cooperation and survival rates under increasing threats compared to loose cultures.

### Conclusions
The findings suggest that cultural and institutional factors play crucial roles in managing national responses to pandemics. Nations with higher levels of cultural tightness and efficient governments could introduce cooperative norms effectively, leading to better outcomes in controlling the spread and mortality associated with COVID-19. The study highlights the importance of fostering compliance with social norms in public health messaging, particularly in loose cultures, to mitigate underestimations of risk and promote collective adherence to health guidelines.

The document analyzes the relationship between cultural tightness, government efficiency, and the spread and mortality rates of COVID-19. Key findings include that cultural tightness and government efficiency are significant predictors for the early spread of the virus, while also acknowledging that more developed countries may experience high infection rates regardless of these factors. The researchers employed several methodologies to address the limitations of their correlational data, including controlling for important covariates, using a longitudinal design, and implementing an evolutionary game theory (EGT) model to explore causal dynamics.

**Key Methodologies and Metrics:**
- **Data Analysis**: The analysis utilized correlational data, controlling for societal wealth, inequality, and average age.
- **Modeling Techniques**: The authors designed an EGT model featuring agents that cooperate or defect, embedded in a toroidal grid with simulated ecological threats affecting payoffs. 
- **Statistical Approaches**: The infection rate was modeled using ordinary least squares regression due to its normal distribution, while mortality likelihood was analyzed with a generalized linear model due to its exponential distribution.
- **Covariates Included**: GDP per capita, Gini coefficient, median age, and population density were considered, with only GDP significantly correlating with infection rates.

**Results:**
- Significant predictors for COVID-19 infection rates were found in cultural tightness (b = -0.14, p = 0.048) and government efficiency (b = -0.20, p = 0.003), with their interaction also highlighted (b = -0.15, p = 0.031).
- The simulations indicated that cultural tightness could enhance cooperation and survival rates under threat.

**Conclusions:**
- Strong social norms and effective government leadership are posited as critical for managing and curbing the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts.
- The paper emphasizes the need for balancing norm enforcement and autonomy, warning against autocratic measures that may harm societal well-being long-term.
- The study posits that cultural looseness might enable more innovative long-term responses to challenges following the initial containment of threats, suggesting a potential shift in cultural adaptability as the situation evolves.

Overall, the authors advocate for reshaping cultural and institutional responses to enhance societal resilience in the face of ongoing health threats.

Thought: I collected the focal claim (negative tightness × efficiency interaction predicting lower COVID-19 infection growth) and the preregistered replication plan. I verified the original paper’s interaction evidence and specific numeric extracts. I examined the Execute report and, as required, validated the generated output files. The saved interaction_model_summary.txt shows the authoritative regression output: the interaction is negative but not statistically significant, with N=55 and relatively high R-squared, and a large condition number indicating multicollinearity. The replication followed the planned pipeline (first-30-days post-threshold, per-country growth coefficients, OLS with interaction and controls), with minor deviations (N=55 vs ~57 due to listwise deletion; different temporal window than the original March 21–30; unweighted OLS). I now summarize and compare original vs replication results and provide an interpretation and recommendations.

Answer: {
  "interpretation_summary": "The preregistered replication successfully computed per-country exponential growth rates (first 30 days after surpassing 1 case/million) and ran an OLS model with the tightness × efficiency interaction and controls.

This attenuates the original reported negative interaction (e.g., b ≈ -0.14 to -0.17, p ≈ 0.03–0.05) and fails to meet the preregistered significance criterion. The model showed R-squared = 0.528 (Adj R-squared = 0.469) with N = 55, and a large condition number (~4.86e5) suggesting multicollinearity among efficiency, tightness, and their interaction that may inflate standard errors. Temporal sampling differences (first-30-days window vs original fixed calendar window) and unweighted OLS may also contribute to the discrepancy.",

  ],
  "notes": "Small-N (≈55 countries) and correlated predictors make interaction detection difficult; the large condition number indicates notable multicollinearity. The replication’s different temporal sampling (first 30 days post-threshold) plausibly changes growth dynamics relative to the original calendar window. Results are directionally consistent but not statistically significant; sensitivity analyses (centering, robust SEs, weighting, temporal window alignment) are recommended to clarify whether insignificance stems from design choices or lack of effect."

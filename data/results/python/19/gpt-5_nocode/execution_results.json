  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10-slim container with pandas, numpy, and statsmodels. Executed the weighted OLS analysis script on the provided country-day COVID-19 dataset, estimating country-level growth rates and regressing them on standardized tightness, efficiency, their interaction, and controls with HC1 robust SEs. The run completed without errors (only a NumPy deprecation warning). Results were saved to gelfand_replication_results.json and gelfand_replication_results.txt. The focal interaction (tightness \u00d7 efficiency) was negative but not statistically significant in this replication sample, while the main effect of tightness was negative and statistically significant. The procedure aligned with the preregistered plan (filtering to total_covid_per_million > 1 up to 2020-03-30, computing slopes, weighted OLS with robust SEs) using the provided subset of countries (N=55).",

  "interpretation_summary": "I compared the preregistered hypothesis (negative tightness \u00d7 efficiency interaction predicting lower infection growth) to the executed replication outputs. The code followed the planned filtering window, growth-rate computation, and weighted OLS with robust SEs. The replication achieved a negative interaction coefficient but it was not statistically significant, whereas the main effect of tightness was negative and significant. The smaller analyzed sample (N=55 countries) relative to the original likely reduced statistical power, leading to attenuation of the interaction\u2019s significance. Overall, the replication aligned well with the plan but did not reproduce the original significant interaction.",

  "notes": "The smaller sample and potential differences in weighting likely reduced power to detect the interaction. Tightness and efficiency may be correlated, and standardization plus sample composition can attenuate interactions. Predicted values were directionally consistent with the original but inference hinges on the interaction term, which was not significant here. Future replications should emphasize matching the original sample, weighting, and control set, and perform sensitivity to different early-pandemic windows."

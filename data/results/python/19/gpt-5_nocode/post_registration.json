      "description": "The study conducted cross-national analyses linking cultural tightness and government efficiency to COVID-19 infection growth rates and mortality likelihood. COVID-19 data were converted to per capita measures and growth rates, then analyzed using OLS regressions with weights. Mortality likelihood was assessed with a generalized linear (logistic) model with an exponential distribution, weighted by days since the first confirmed case. Models included the interaction between cultural tightness and government efficiency and controlled for economic and demographic factors. An evolutionary game theory simulation (20x20 grid prisoner\u2019s dilemma) examined how cultural tightness under ecological threat affects cooperative dynamics.",

      "summary": "Across 141 countries, higher cultural tightness and greater government efficiency were each associated with slower COVID-19 infection growth rates, and their interaction further reduced growth. OLS models showed negative coefficients for tightness and efficiency, with GDP per capita positively associated with growth rates. Mortality likelihood was lower in countries with both high tightness and high government efficiency, with predicted mortality around 1.48% versus 2.91% in low tightness/efficiency contexts. Additional analyses reported significant interactions and robustness across specifications. A game-theoretic simulation indicated that tight cultures maintain higher cooperation and survival under increasing ecological threat.",

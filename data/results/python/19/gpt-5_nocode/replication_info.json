Some countries have missing efficiency (Kazakhstan, Sweden; data dictionary) and Gini values; we impute Gini from alternative_gini where available, mirroring notes in the data dictionary. The provided replication dataset includes 63 countries (get_dataset_variable_summary for country), which may be fewer than the 141 countries in the original (post_registration.json; original_paper.pdf summary), making this a partial sample replication."

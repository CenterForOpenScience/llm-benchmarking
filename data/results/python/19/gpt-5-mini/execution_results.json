  "execution_summary": "I generated the Docker runtime for the study and built the image, then started a container. The repository lacked the expected Python entrypoint, so I created replication_data/Analysis_script_v2__py.py implementing the two-step pipeline described in replication_info.json (1) estimate country-specific slopes of log(total_covid_per_million) over the first 30 days after exceeding 1 per million; (2) regress those slopes on the interaction eff_tight (efficiency * tightness) plus controls. I iteratively fixed file-path issues so the script could find the CSV inside the container, executed the script, and saved outputs. The analysis ran successfully and produced country slopes (estimatedcoefficients_replication.csv) and a regression summary (regression_summary_replication.txt). The primary coefficient on eff_tight is negative but not statistically significant at p < 0.05 in this replication. The workflow followed the preregistered plan and used the provided CSV; I made no substantive changes to the analysis specification beyond implementing the pipeline in Python and pragmatic path handling.",

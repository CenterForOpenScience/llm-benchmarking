2026-02-05 16:28:33,546 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input:
Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- Any missing code should be written to replication_data inside the study path.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

**Phases of Execution:**

PHASE 1: BUILD ENVIRONMENT
1. `orchestrator_generate_dockerfile`: Creates _runtime/Dockerfile from replication_info.json.
2. `orchestrator_build_image`: Builds the image.
   * IF BUILD FAILS: Read the error log. It usually means a missing system package or R/Python library. Edit `replication_info.json` to add the missing dependency, regenerate the Dockerfile, and rebuild.

PHASE 2: PREPARE RUNTIME
3. `orchestrator_run_container`: Mounts the code and data and starts the container.
4. `orchestrator_plan` & `orchestrator_preview_entry`: Verify what will run.

PHASE 3: HUMAN APPROVAL (Strict Check)
5. Before running the actual analysis code, you MUST Ask the human:
   Action: ask_human_input: "Ready to execute command: <COMMAND>. Approve? (yes/no)"
   * If they say "no", stop the container and fill the output JSON with status "cancelled".
   * If they say "yes", proceed to Phase 4.

PHASE 4: EXECUTE & DEBUG
6. `orchestrator_execute_entry`: Runs the code.
   * IF EXECUTION FAILS (exit_code != 0): 
     - Read the `stderr` in the observation.
     - Identify if it is a code error or missing library.
     - Use `write_file` to fix the script or `replication_info.json`.
     - If you changed dependencies, you must go back to Phase 1 (Rebuild).
     - If you only changed code, you can retry `orchestrator_execute_entry`.

PHASE 5: FINALIZE
7. `orchestrator_stop_container`: Cleanup.
8. Parse `execution_result.json` and output the Answer in the following required JSON schema.
"{\n  \"execution_summary\": \"A narrative overview of the execution process, including key steps followed, overall success, and alignment with the preregistration (e.g., 'The OLS regression was executed on the 1999 ARIS-REDS dataset, testing the hypothesis on low-caste households.

FROM THE DATA FINDER, SECTION 12B

The discrepancy between 57 countries in the preprint and 63 countries in the csv 
is likely accounted for by the exclusion of 6 countries that the corresponding 
author noted via email: Belgium, France, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, and Venezuela. 

For these six countries, the data collection that produced the tightness measure 
was conducted earlier than for the rest of the countries. The corresponding author 
recommended excluding the six countries from the replication attempt, as they 
did in the original analysis.

2026-02-05 16:33:44,386 - replication - INFO - ***Agent output (Thought):
Thought: I need to implement a Python script that reproduces the .do logic. I'll write replication_data/Analysis_script_v2__py.py using pandas and statsmodels to: read CSV, drop six countries, parse date, reindex per country and forward-fill, keep total_covid_per_million >1, compute log, create time variable, limit to time<=30, compute per-country OLS slope of ltotalcases on time, save estimatedcoefficients_replication.csv and regression_summary_replication.txt, and ensure file paths use /app/data/... The replication_info.json expects the script at replication_data/Analysis_script_v2__py.py. I'll create the file with write_file. 
Action: write_file to create the Python script.

Thought: Now execute the entry in the running container. I'll call orchestrator_execute_entry again. 
Action: orchestrator_execute_entry with the study path.

2026-02-05 16:34:34,150 - replication - INFO - ***Agent output (Thought):
Thought: The script failed because the INPUT_CSV path is incorrect; the container mounts project root at /app/data, so the file path should be /app/data/replication_data/gelfand_replication_data.csv or /app/data/data/original/... but simpler to use relative path inside project. I'll modify the script to read from /app/data/data/original/19/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data/gelfand_replication_data.csv? Wait the error shows that path was used but file not present. The actual mounted path inside container likely is /app/data (project root) which contains replication_data at data/original/... So path should be /app/data/data/original/19/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data/gelfand_replication_data.csv — that's what I used and file not found. Inspect container mount? But easier: read the repository to find where gelfand_replication_data.csv is relative. In host, file is at data/original/19/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data/gelfand_replication_data.csv relative to project root. Within container, /app/data should map to project root. So full path should be /app/data/data/original/19/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data/gelfand_replication_data.csv — that's what I used. But file was not found; maybe container's /app/data is mounted differently (like /app/data contains only the replication_data folder, not full repo). Check replication_info.json earlier indicated volumes "./data:/app/data". That maps host ./data to /app/data — but our current workspace when running container is study path, earlier orchestrator_run_container might set mounts differently. Simpler approach: Make script locate the CSV by searching /app/data recursively for gelfand_replication_data.csv. I'll update the script to search for the file if path not found. Use edit_file to replace the INPUT_CSV logic. 
Action: edit_file to replace the top path block to search for CSV under /app/data.

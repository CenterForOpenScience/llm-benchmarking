2026-02-05 16:36:28,344 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input:
Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- Any missing code should be written to replication_data inside the study path.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

**Phases of Execution:**

PHASE 1: BUILD ENVIRONMENT
1. `orchestrator_generate_dockerfile`: Creates _runtime/Dockerfile from replication_info.json.
2. `orchestrator_build_image`: Builds the image.
   * IF BUILD FAILS: Read the error log. It usually means a missing system package or R/Python library. Edit `replication_info.json` to add the missing dependency, regenerate the Dockerfile, and rebuild.

PHASE 2: PREPARE RUNTIME
3. `orchestrator_run_container`: Mounts the code and data and starts the container.
4. `orchestrator_plan` & `orchestrator_preview_entry`: Verify what will run.

PHASE 3: HUMAN APPROVAL (Strict Check)
5. Before running the actual analysis code, you MUST Ask the human:
   Action: ask_human_input: "Ready to execute command: <COMMAND>. Approve? (yes/no)"
   * If they say "no", stop the container and fill the output JSON with status "cancelled".
   * If they say "yes", proceed to Phase 4.

PHASE 4: EXECUTE & DEBUG
6. `orchestrator_execute_entry`: Runs the code.
   * IF EXECUTION FAILS (exit_code != 0): 
     - Read the `stderr` in the observation.
     - Identify if it is a code error or missing library.
     - Use `write_file` to fix the script or `replication_info.json`.
     - If you changed dependencies, you must go back to Phase 1 (Rebuild).
     - If you only changed code, you can retry `orchestrator_execute_entry`.

PHASE 5: FINALIZE
7. `orchestrator_stop_container`: Cleanup.
8. Parse `execution_result.json` and output the Answer in the following required JSON schema.
"{\n  \"execution_summary\": \"A narrative overview of the execution process, including key steps followed, overall success, and alignment with the preregistration (e.g., 'The OLS regression was executed on the 1999 ARIS-REDS dataset, testing the hypothesis on low-caste households.

Thought: The file path inside container might be /app/data/data/... but mounting specifics: earlier replication_info.json said volumes: ['./data:/app/data']. The repository root likely maps such that CSV path is /app/data/data/original/19/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data/... but initial attempt failed. Let's inspect the container's /app/data listing via executing a shell command—however tools don't allow direct shell. But we can try different plausible paths. The earlier read_file outside container showed file exists at data/original/19/0205-gpt5-mini/replication_data/gelfand... accessible from host. The orchestrator mounts project root to /app/data, but project root probably contains folder 'data', so inside container the CSV is at /app/data/data/original/19/0205-gpt5-mini/replication_data/gelfand... which was the first path and failed earlier due to double 'data' confusion. Yet earlier error was FileNotFound for that too. Hmm. But read_file inside container previously attempted and failed. Alternatively, maybe files aren't mounted into container because of orchestrator config. But typical pattern: mount project root to /app/data and then path inside container is /app/data/data/... However both /app/data/data/... and /app/data/replication_data/... failed. Let's open replication_info.json earlier where it noted the script should read from /app/data/data/original/... It was initially set like that. The container may not have the data mounted; perhaps mount path is different. Let's check execution_result or container logs; orchestrator_execute_entry returned stdout showing the attempted read path. Next step: list files at root of project from the host perspective to confirm correct relative path. We already listed files earlier. The correct path on host is data/original/19/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data/gelfand_replication_data.csv. The container should have that at /app/data/data/original/... To determine actual mount inside container, check replication_info.json 'volumes' used: "./data:/app/data". That maps host './data' to container '/app/data'. The file should exist inside container at '/app/data/original/19/0205-gpt5-mini/replication_data/gelfand_replication_data.csv' only if './data' points to repository root with a folder 'original', but our host path is data/original/... Wait mapping './data' means relative to study_path? Not sure. This is taking long. Simpler approach: modify script to try multiple possible paths in order until found. Update DATA_CSV logic to check a list of candidate paths and pick the first existing. I'll change the script to search a list and select. 
Action: edit_file to replace the DATA_CSV assignment and reading block with logic to try candidate paths.

Thought: I built the Docker runtime, started a container, found the Python entrypoint was missing, wrote a Python translation of the Stata script, fixed file-path issues, executed the script inside the container, and saved outputs. Now I will produce the required final JSON summary describing the execution, commands run, logs, environment, and the main results extracted from the executed regression.

Answer: {
  "execution_summary": "I generated the Docker runtime for the study and built the image, then started a container. The repository lacked the expected Python entrypoint, so I created replication_data/Analysis_script_v2__py.py implementing the two-step pipeline described in replication_info.json (1) estimate country-specific slopes of log(total_covid_per_million) over the first 30 days after exceeding 1 per million; (2) regress those slopes on the interaction eff_tight (efficiency * tightness) plus controls. I iteratively fixed file-path issues so the script could find the CSV inside the container, executed the script, and saved outputs. The analysis ran successfully and produced country slopes (estimatedcoefficients_replication.csv) and a regression summary (regression_summary_replication.txt). The primary coefficient on eff_tight is negative but not statistically significant at p < 0.05 in this replication. The workflow followed the preregistered plan and used the provided CSV; I made no substantive changes to the analysis specification beyond implementing the pipeline in Python and pragmatic path handling.",

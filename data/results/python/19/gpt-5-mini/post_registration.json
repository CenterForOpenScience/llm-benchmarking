      "description": "The study combined cross-national observational analyses and agent-based simulations. Empirical analyses used country-level COVID-19 cases and deaths from the ECDC, cultural tightness indices, and the World Bank Government Effectiveness Index. Infection growth rates were log-transformed and regressed on cultural tightness, government efficiency, their interaction, and controls (GDP per capita, Gini coefficient, median age). Mortality likelihood (deaths/cases) was modeled (reported using an exponential distribution / logistic modeling approach). An evolutionary game-theory agent-based simulation (prisoner's dilemma style) examined how cultural tightness affects cooperation and survival under varying threat levels.",

A significant interaction indicates that nations with both high cultural tightness and high government efficiency experienced substantially slower spread and lower mortality. Agent-based simulations indicate that higher cultural tightness promotes cooperative behavior under moderate-to-severe threat, improving survival.",

{
  "hypothesis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis in the extracted JSON is an exact match with the reference document. Both state that among low-caste households, residing in villages dominated by lower castes is associated with higher agricultural income compared to villages dominated by upper castes."
  },
  "study_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The study type is correctly identified as 'Observational' in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.dataset_identifier": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON mentions 'analysis_data.dta (derived LSMS village & household survey, 1997-1998)', while the reference document refers to the ARIS-REDS 1999 data. There is a partial overlap in the description of the data source, but significant differences exist."
  },
  "data_plan.source_type": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON describes the source as a 'Household/village survey (Living Standards Measurement Study \u2013 LSMS) merged with village-level caste dominance information', which is mostly similar to the reference document's description of using village-level data on land ownership and caste composition."
  },
  "data_plan.wave_or_subset": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON mentions a single 1997-1998 LSMS wave, while the reference document refers to the 1999 ARIS-REDS data. There is a significant difference in the wave or subset used."
  },
  "data_plan.sample_size": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON states a sample size of 2,610 households, while the reference document mentions 2,537 households. There is a discrepancy in the sample size reported."
  },
  "data_plan.unit_of_analysis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Both the extracted JSON and the reference document identify the unit of analysis as 'Household'."
  },
  "data_plan.access_details": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON states 'Provided in replication_data folder; no additional restrictions', while the reference document mentions access through Andrew Foster\u2019s homepage with IRB approval. There is a significant difference in access details."
  },
  "planned_method.steps": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The steps in the extracted JSON are mostly similar to the reference document, with both describing the estimation of OLS models and clustering standard errors at the village level. However, there are differences in the specific steps and datasets used."
  },
  "planned_method.models": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Both the extracted JSON and the reference document describe using linear regression (OLS) with village-clustered standard errors and state-by-caste fixed effects."
  },
  "planned_method.outcome_variable": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON mentions 'raw_inc_per_acre (primary); net_inc_per_acre (robustness)', while the reference document refers to 'Crop Income per Acre'. The core meaning is preserved, but there are differences in phrasing."
  },
  "planned_method.independent_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Both the extracted JSON and the reference document identify 'locaste_land_v (1 = BAC-dominated village)' as the primary independent variable."
  },
  "planned_method.control_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Both the extracted JSON and the reference document list 'literate_hh (household literacy share), land_owned (acres owned), state\u00d7caste fixed effects' as control variables."
  },
  "planned_method.tools_software": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON mentions 'Python 3.10, pandas, pyreadstat, statsmodels', while the reference document uses Stata. There is a significant difference in the tools and software used."

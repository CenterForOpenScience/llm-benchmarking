      "summary": "Lower-caste households realize markedly higher crop income and yields in BAC-dominated villages than in upper-caste dominated villages. The gains are strongest for households that buy irrigation water, indicating that intra-caste groundwater trade mitigates enforcement problems that hinder cross-caste transactions. IV estimates confirm that improved irrigation access, rather than land quality, drives the income differential.",

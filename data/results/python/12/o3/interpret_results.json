  "interpretation_summary": "The preregistered replication executed successfully after several rounds of debugging path-handling and cluster-SE issues.  The final Python script reproduced the intended ordinary-least-squares model with village\u2013clustered standard errors for three specifications (full sample, alternative outcome, and UP/Bihar subset).  All three replicated coefficients on the key treatment (low-caste-dominated village) are small, negative and statistically insignificant, whereas the original study reported a large positive and highly significant effect.  Methodological fidelity is high with respect to the preregistration, but two substantive deviations from the original design remain: (i) the main analysis uses a broader 17-state LSMS sample (although a UP/Bihar subset was run as a robustness check) and (ii) instrumental-variables estimation used in the original paper was not replicated.  Overall, the replication does not support the original claim under any tested specification.",

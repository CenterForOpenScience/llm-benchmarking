        "explanation": "This dataset contains household- and village-level variables required to test the focal claim (income differences by village caste dominance).

The provided analysis_data.dta includes these variables (see variables list and descriptions inspected from data/original/12/0205_gpt5-mini/replication_data/analysis_data.dta). References: post_registration.json (data description) and initial_details.txt (focal claim and coefficient), and actual dataset columns inspected in replication_data folder.",
        "deviation_from_original": "Potential deviations: the original study summary in post_registration.json mentions ~2,250 households across 120 villages; the replication data contains 2610 observations (analysis_data.dta). This suggests either a slightly different cleaning or inclusion rule (post_registration.json vs replication_data). The .do file included in the replication_data indicates the analysis steps and matches the variables; thus deviations are small and likely reflect either full sample vs rounded sample-size reporting or additional cases in the provided analysis_data.dta. Sources: post_registration.json (original sample description) and inspection of analysis_data.dta (2610 rows)."

Uses descriptive comparisons, OLS regressions with controls (education, land, state/district fixed effects), interaction terms between water-buyer status and village caste dominance, and instrumental variables (2SLS) to address endogeneity in private water market participation. Identification strategy leverages historical land-settlement patterns and zamindari reform as plausibly exogenous determinants of village-level caste dominance. Robustness checks evaluate geographic distance, groundwater quality, tenancy and credit relations, and land quality.",

      "summary": "Low-caste households experience substantially better agricultural outcomes when living in villages dominated by backward agricultural castes (BACs) compared to high-caste dominated villages. Differences are driven primarily by better access to irrigation via private groundwater markets in low-caste dominated villages and more effective within-caste water trade and contract enforcement. Descriptive statistics show much higher crop incomes and yields in low-caste dominated villages. Regression results (OLS and IV) indicate positive and statistically significant effects of low-caste village dominance on crop income and that the benefit is concentrated among water buyers in low-caste villages. Alternative explanations (geography, groundwater quality, tenancy, credit, land quality) do not account for the observed differences.",

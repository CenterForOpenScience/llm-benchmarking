  "interpretation_summary": "I executed the preregistered replication plan by running OLS regressions on the provided analysis_data.dta with the same main regressors (literate_hh, land_owned, locaste_land_v) and state-by-caste interactions, using cluster-robust standard errors at the village level. The execution required two implementation fixes (correcting data path resolution and aligning the cluster groups with the model rows after NA-dropping); these were technical fixes and do not reflect substantive departures from the planned method. High-level outcome: the replication does not reproduce the original focal numeric claim (a large positive locaste_land_v coefficient of ~566.5, SE ~209). In our outputs the locaste_land_v coefficient is near zero and statistically insignificant in the main and secondary specifications, while the 'caste' main effect and several state-by-caste interaction terms are small but some are statistically significant. Sample sizes differ modestly (original text reported ~2,250 households; our analysis used N = 2,537 in the main regressions and N = 496 in the UP/B subset), which may reflect a different cleaning or dataset version in the replication package.",

The preregistered test (effect of locaste_land_v on raw_inc_per_acre) yields coefficients near zero and not statistically significant in our runs, so we do not reproduce the reported 566.5 effect. However, related parameters (caste main effect and several state-by-caste interactions) show some small significant effects in our specification; these are not equivalent to the original reported single coefficient."

The original paper may have reported a coefficient from a different specification or table cell (e.g., a bivariate, IV, or aggregated coefficient). Re-run the replication matching each table in the original paper (and the exact etable keep/order options) to locate the reported coefficient.

To prevent future issues, add robust path discovery to the script (try multiple candidate mount points) and include automated checks that the cluster vector length equals the model's row count before computing clustered covariances. Document any changes to the Python translation and keep the original .do file as reference so others can trace methodological fidelity."

  ],
  "notes": "Caveats and further checks: (1) The regression outputs include a large condition number warning (multicollinearity / numerical issues), so coefficient estimates (and SEs) may be sensitive. (2) The original reported numeric (566.5) likely refers to a different model, variable scaling, or a specific etable output row; direct numeric mismatches can arise from differences in the exact specification, sample, or transformations. (3) Recommend: (a) run the original Stata .do with the original authors' environment (if possible) to reproduce the etable and identify which coefficient corresponds to 566.5, (b) verify whether income units/aggregation differ between the original reported result and the per-acre measures used here, and (c) run sensitivity analyses (alternate codings, inclusion/exclusion of fixed effects, and IV specifications) to check for specification dependence."

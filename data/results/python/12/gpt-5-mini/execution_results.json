  "execution_summary": "I generated a Dockerfile, built the image, started the container, and executed the Python analysis entrypoint anderson_2011_replication_data_analysis__py.py. I fixed two issues encountered during execution: (1) the script referenced an incorrect absolute data path, so I updated the script to search several candidate paths for analysis_data.dta; and (2) cluster-robust SE computation originally passed a groups vector misaligned with model rows after NA dropping, so I updated the script to fit OLS and then compute clustered robust covariance with groups aligned to the rows used by the model. After these fixes, the script ran successfully and produced three regression output files. The executed analysis matches the original's approach (OLS with cluster-robust SEs). The preregistered hypothesis examined whether low-caste households living in low-caste villages have higher agricultural income; the outputs show coefficients for caste and caste-by-state interactions rather than a single 'low-caste villages' coefficient of 566.5 from the original claim, and our results do not reproduce that large positive coefficient in the same form. No major deviations from the planned regressions were made besides fixing file paths and aligning cluster groups for robust SEs (these were necessary implementation fixes).",

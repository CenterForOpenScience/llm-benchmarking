The replication dataset provides the same operational variables: raw_inc_per_acre (outcome), locaste_land_v (key predictor), literate_hh and land_owned (controls), stcode and caste for fixed effects, and vill_id for clustering (analysis_data.dta columns; anderson_2011_replication_data_analysis.do shows identical model inputs).",

The replication dataset spans multiple states (stcode Min=1, Max=17; get_dataset_variable_summary), with 2,610 observations (get_dataset_shape), exceeding the original sample size (2,250). While our main specification uses the full replication sample, we also run a subset for UP and Bihar (stcode in {2,15}) to align with the original focus (anderson_2011_replication_data_analysis.do)."

      "description": "The study exploits cross-village variation in dominant caste (based on land ownership) in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to compare agricultural outcomes and irrigation access. It estimates OLS models of agricultural income/yields on indicators for village caste dominance and water market participation, and uses IV (2SLS) to address endogeneity of water-buyer status with instruments capturing natural water access and village area. Controls include education, land ownership, land quality, and crop choices. The analysis examines groundwater market functioning, especially interactions between water-buyer status and low-caste dominated villages.",

      "summary": "Lower-caste households achieve higher agricultural income and yields in low-caste dominated villages, largely due to better access to private irrigation via functioning groundwater markets. The interaction between living in a low-caste dominated village and being a water buyer is strongly positive in both OLS and IV estimates. Low-caste dominated villages have higher irrigated area shares and higher tubewell ownership among lower castes. Alternative explanations such as land quality, infrastructure, and tenancy do not account for the observed differences.",

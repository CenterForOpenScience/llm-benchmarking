2. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/replication_info.json: Structured report of the agent at the PLANNING stage for the replication of the given claim.
3. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/replication_data: The folder containing the data and code that were used for the replication, along with any output files generated after running the code. You MUST examine any additional execution result files not reported in execution_results.json before making your interpretataions.
4. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/execution_results.json: Final structured report of the execution stage by the agent. If the report doesn't have any results, look for output files generated by the code to find the execution results before making conclusions.

The income is substantially higher for low-caste households residing in villages dominated by a low caste. The estimation results show the robustness of the positive relationship between agricultural income and residing in a low-caste dominated village.

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

    Replication attempt to evaluate a claim from Anderson_AmEcoJourn_2011_bLe8
Replication team: Nathaniel Porter, Anirudh Tagat, and Jing Geng
SCORE RR ID: 329k
OSF Project: https://osf.io/t95k2
Description of generalizability
The main deviation between the two datasets is that the replication study includes all Indian states, not just Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The other potential deviation is the identification of Backward Agricultural Castes (BACs), which are important for testing the focal claim in the paper. There is no ready classification for this in ARIS-REDS, and will need to be coded by hand or manually against a reference that delineates caste identity into the groups specified in the paper. This is possible because ARIS-REDS contains detailed data on caste and sub-caste at the household level.
Additionally, data on income and village caste/land-holdings were collected in different ways and thus not fully compatible, though they should approximate the same concepts.
Claim evaluation
Single-trace claim
Coded claim 4 text (original paper): “The estimation results from Table 3 confirm the robustness of the positive relationship between agricultural income and residing in a low-caste dominated village. [The coefficient for “Low-caste villages” is 566.5 with robust standard errors of 209, significant at the 1 percent level.]”
Replication outcome: Simple test
Inferential criteria: H* will be considered confirmed if the coefficient for locaste_land_v (Low-caste village) is positive and significant at the p<0.05 level.
Result: The claim was not replicated. The coefficient for Low-caste villages (locaste_land_v) was non-signficiant (p=0.1343) and non-positive (b=-10.058).
Deviations from the preregistration: No deviations.
Additional analyses 
Two additional analyses were performed to test the robustness of the findings when (1) net agricultural income is used instead of total agricultural income and (2) only the two original states are included in analysis.
Exploratory Analysis using Net Income per Acre (instead of gross income)
Result: The claim was not replicated. The coefficient for Low-caste villages (locaste_land_v) was non-signficiant (p=0.6059) and non-positive (b=-2.412).
Deviations from the preregistration: No deviations.
Discussion: The increased standard errors and reduced model fit suggest that net income may fit more poorly than gross income as a dependent variable. However, this may indicate poor generalizable value of the original study, if the results were able to be tested with the more substantively-meaningful net income variable (that is, net income is more relevant than gross income to household economics).
Exploratory Analysis using only Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (instead of all states)
Result: The claim was not replicated. The coefficient for Low-caste villages (locaste_land_v) was non-signficiant (p=0.0545) and non-positive (b=-21.144).
Deviations from the preregistration: No deviations.
Discussion: Despite a smaller sample size, the model fit was much higher (R-squared of 0.38 compared to 0.9) when using only cases from the states in the original paper (Uttar Pradesh and Bihar). The authors suggested there were specific characteristics in terms of caste, poverty and agricultural economics that made them better suited than others, although the original data also did not offer the chance to test beyond Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, given it was a survey of only those two states.

General discussion
The consistently non-significant findings (and in the opposite direction of the original) across 3 model specifications suggest one of the following: (1) the original findings were highly dependent on specific methods of defining variables that could not be fully replicated through a combination of poor reporting and data difference, (2) the original findings were dependent on the specifics of the data itself, such as period and collection method or period/method related effects of excluded covariates, or(3) the original findings were related to chance.
Option 1 likely played at least some role, as the way in which data on caste classification, village caste domination and farm income were coded varied substantially from the original. Without further examination of the original data, we are unable to draw conclusions about the extent to which this should be considered limitations of the replication versus poor robustness of the original study.
Option 2 is also likely relevant. Table 4 (p. 250) in the original study, which conducts similar analysis with different controls, consistently shows across models that the apparent effect of low-caste villages is driven by an interaction with whether households buy water. Thus differences between states and villages, or across time, in patterns of water buyership could easily have driven differences between the original and replication findings.
Option 3 cannot be ruled out, but should not be assumed, given options 1 and 2 both appear likely to have a role.

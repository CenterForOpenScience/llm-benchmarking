***Agent input: 
Question: You are an experienced researcher. You are assessing a replication attempt of a research claim.
You are given the following information about the research claim:
1. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/original_paper.pdf: The pdf file containing the full text of the original paper
2. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/initial_details.txt: Details about the claim from the original paper to be replicated
3. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/replication_data: The folder containing the data and code that can be used for the replication.


You are given the following information about the replication attempt.
1. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/post_registration.json: A structured document with key extracted information about the original paper and the claim to be replicated.
2. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/_log/: Folder contain the logs of the agent replication attempt. Focus on the logs of the design and the execute stage for this evaluation.
3. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/replication_info.json: Final structured report of the design stage by the agent.
4. data/original/12/0112_gpt5/execution_results.json: Final strcuterd report of the execution stage by the agent.



Your task is to score the replication attempt by filling out this structured rubric

Thought: To evaluate the replication attempt, I need to gather information from the provided files, particularly focusing on the design and execution stages. I will start by examining the `replication_info.json` to assess the design stage, which includes environment, dependency, and file system checks. Then, I will review the `execution_results.json` to evaluate the execution stage, focusing on code execution and the execution report. 

First, I will read the `replication_info.json` to gather information about the design stage.

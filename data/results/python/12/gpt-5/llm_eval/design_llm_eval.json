{
  "hypothesis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis in the extracted JSON is an exact match with the reference document. Both state that among low-caste households, residing in a low-caste dominated village is associated with higher agricultural income per acre compared to residing in an upper-caste dominated village, with similar controls and effects."
  },
  "study_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The study type is correctly identified as 'Observational' in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.dataset_identifier": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The dataset identifier 'analysis_data.dta (replication_data folder)' is mostly similar to the reference, which mentions ARIS-REDS 1999 data. The identifier is specific to the replication study."
  },
  "data_plan.source_type": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The source type is mostly similar. The extracted JSON mentions a 'Household/village survey-derived dataset' aligned with World Bank LSMS UP\u2013Bihar design, which is consistent with the reference's description of using ARIS-REDS data."
  },
  "data_plan.wave_or_subset": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The wave or subset information is mostly similar. The extracted JSON specifies low-caste households across multiple states, aligning with the reference's mention of ARIS-REDS data covering 17 states."
  },
  "data_plan.sample_size": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The sample size in the extracted JSON is 2,610, which is loosely related to the reference's 2,537 households. The numbers are close but not identical."
  },
  "data_plan.unit_of_analysis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The unit of analysis is an exact match. Both the extracted JSON and the reference document specify 'Household' as the unit of analysis."
  },
  "data_plan.access_details": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The access details are mostly similar. The extracted JSON provides a specific path and mentions no additional restrictions, while the reference mentions access through Andrew Foster\u2019s homepage with IRB approval."
  },
  "planned_method.steps": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The steps are mostly similar. The extracted JSON provides a detailed plan for conducting the analysis, which aligns with the reference's description of the analysis process."
  },
  "planned_method.models": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The models used are an exact match. Both the extracted JSON and the reference document describe using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with village-clustered robust standard errors."
  },
  "planned_method.outcome_variable": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The outcome variable is an exact match. Both the extracted JSON and the reference document specify 'raw_inc_per_acre' as the primary outcome variable."
  },
  "planned_method.independent_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The independent variables are an exact match. Both the extracted JSON and the reference document specify 'locaste_land_v' as the key independent variable."
  },
  "planned_method.control_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The control variables are an exact match. Both the extracted JSON and the reference document list 'literate_hh' and 'land_owned' as control variables, with state-by-caste interactions."
  },
  "planned_method.tools_software": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The tools and software are mostly similar. The extracted JSON mentions Python 3.10 and specific packages, while the reference document does not specify software but implies Stata usage."

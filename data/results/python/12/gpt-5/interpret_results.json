  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed the preregistered OLS with village-clustered SEs and state-by-caste fixed effects on an independent low-caste household dataset. Three specifications were estimated (full sample on raw income per acre, exploratory net income per acre, and a UP/Bihar subset). In contrast to the original positive and significant estimate (coef=566.5, SE=209, p<0.01), all replicated estimates for living in a low-caste dominated village (locaste_land_v) are small, negative, and statistically insignificant, with confidence intervals spanning zero. While sample composition and potential unit scaling differences limit direct magnitude comparability, the sign and significance do not support the original claim under the preregistered comparison.",

Future work should assess robustness to alternative FE structures, additional controls, and the original interaction/IV specifications."

      "description": "The study examines how village-level caste dominance affects household agricultural outcomes through access to groundwater markets. Using village and household data from UP\u2013Bihar (1997\u20131998) and the 2001 Census, the authors compare outcomes across upper-caste and lower-caste dominated villages. They estimate OLS models of crop income and yields on a low-caste village indicator with controls, analyze water market participation, and estimate interaction models between low-caste dominance and water-buyer status. To address endogeneity of water-buyer status, they use instrumental variables with village natural water source access and village area as instruments, and conduct robustness checks for geography, groundwater quality, tenancy, credit, and segregation.",

      "summary": "Lower caste households achieve substantially higher agricultural income and yields in villages dominated by lower castes relative to upper-caste dominated villages. The key mechanism is improved access to private groundwater irrigation and more effective trade within groundwater markets among same-caste participants. The interaction of being a water buyer and residing in a low-caste dominated village is strongly associated with higher crop income. IV estimates support a causal interpretation, and instruments are strong. Alternative explanations related to geography, groundwater quality, tenancy, credit, and segregation do not account for the differences.",

It retains the key constructs needed to test the focal claim (village low-caste dominance indicator, household agricultural income per acre, controls for literacy and land ownership, and state fixed effects).",

        "deviation_from_original": "The dataset here appears already restricted to lower-caste households (locaste == 1 according to variable summary), while the original paper analyzes lower-caste subsamples alongside broader samples. Some controls (e.g., district fixed effects and additional environmental/credit/tenancy controls) are not included due to absence in the dataset (post_registration.json mentions these controls; dataset inspection shows stcode but not district identifiers). Thus, the replication focuses on the core OLS specification with literacy, land-owned, and state FE."

  "interpretation_summary": "The replication executed as planned (OLS with HC1 and village-clustered SEs on net_inc_per_acre ~ locaste_land_v + controls + state FE) and produced results. However, while the original paper reports a large and statistically significant positive association (coef \u2248 566.5, SE \u2248 209, p<0.01), the replication estimate is near zero and non-significant (coef \u2248 0.413, p\u22480.90; clustered p\u22480.919). The sign is positive but the magnitude and significance diverge dramatically. Inspection of the outcome\u2019s distribution suggests a potential unit/scale mismatch relative to the original descriptive levels, and the replication uses a streamlined specification (state FE with fewer controls than the original, and possibly a different outcome operationalization). Overall, the replication does not corroborate the original claim under the implemented specification.",

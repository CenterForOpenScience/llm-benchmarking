{
  "hypothesis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis in the extracted JSON matches the reference document's hypothesis. Both state that among lower-caste households, residing in a low-caste dominated village is associated with higher agricultural income compared to residing in an upper-caste dominated village."
  },
  "study_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The study type is correctly identified as 'Observational' in both the extracted JSON and the reference document."
  },
  "data_plan.source_type": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON describes the source as a 'Field survey-based dataset harmonized for analysis,' which is mostly similar to the reference document's description of using existing data from surveys. However, the reference document specifies the ARIS-REDS dataset, which is not mentioned in the extracted JSON."
  },
  "data_plan.wave_or_subset": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON specifies household-level observations from villages in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which aligns with the reference document. However, the reference document includes more detail about the dataset covering 12 districts in Uttar Pradesh and 13 in Bihar, which is not mentioned in the extracted JSON."
  },
  "data_plan.sample_size": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON states a sample size of 2610 observations, while the reference document mentions a sample size of 2,537 households. This discrepancy indicates a partial overlap but significant difference."
  },
  "data_plan.unit_of_analysis": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "Both the extracted JSON and the reference document specify the unit of analysis as 'Household.'"
  },
  "data_plan.access_details": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON provides specific access details for the dataset, which is mostly similar to the reference document's description of data access procedures. However, the reference document includes more detail about the data access process and restrictions."
  },
  "planned_method.steps": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The procedural steps in the extracted JSON are detailed and align well with the reference document's description of the analysis process, including data loading, OLS estimation, and saving outputs."
  },
  "planned_method.models": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON specifies 'Linear OLS regression with heteroskedasticity-robust (HC1) SEs,' which matches the reference document's description of the statistical model used."
  },
  "planned_method.outcome_variable": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The outcome variable 'net_inc_per_acre' in the extracted JSON matches the reference document's description of 'Crop Income per Acre.'"
  },
  "planned_method.independent_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The independent variables in the extracted JSON, including 'locaste_land_v' and controls, align with the reference document's description of the variables used in the analysis."
  },
  "planned_method.control_variables": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The control variables listed in the extracted JSON, such as 'literate_hh' and 'land_owned,' match the reference document's description of control variables used in the analysis."
  },
  "planned_method.tools_software": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The extracted JSON specifies the use of Python and relevant packages, which aligns with the reference document's description of the software used for analysis."

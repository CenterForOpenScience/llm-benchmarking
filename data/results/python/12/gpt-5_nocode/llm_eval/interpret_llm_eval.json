  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The summary provides a detailed narrative of the replication process and outcomes, highlighting key differences in results and potential reasons for these differences. However, it does not fully align with the reference document, which mentions specific deviations and exploratory analyses that are not covered in the summary."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The execution status is correctly reported as 'Success,' which aligns with the reference document indicating that the replication was carried out as planned."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The method alignment is mostly similar to the reference, describing the use of OLS regression and specific controls. However, it does not mention the exploratory analyses or the specific deviations noted in the reference document."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The issue description regarding outcome scale/operationalization is mostly similar to the reference, which mentions differences in data collection methods and potential coding issues. However, the reference provides more context on the deviations."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact assessment is mostly similar, noting a high impact due to scale mismatch. The reference document also suggests that variable definitions could not be fully replicated, affecting results."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].issue_description": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The issue description about control set differences is mostly similar to the reference, which mentions deviations in variable definitions and controls. However, the reference provides more detailed context."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[1].impact": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The impact assessment is mostly similar, noting moderate/unknown effects due to control differences. The reference document also suggests that data differences could affect results."
  },
  "results_comparison.hypothesis_tested": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis tested is an exact match with the reference document, which states the same hypothesis regarding low-caste villages and agricultural income."
  },
  "results_comparison.original_results": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The original results are an exact match with the reference document, which provides the same coefficient, standard error, and significance level."
  },
  "results_comparison.replication_results": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The replication results are loosely related to the reference, which reports different coefficients and significance levels. The reference indicates a non-significant and non-positive result, while the JSON reports a positive but insignificant result."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The overall answer is an exact match with the reference document, which states that the replication did not meet the preregistered criteria."
  },
  "replication_report": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The replication report is mostly similar to the reference, noting the lack of support for the original claim. However, the reference provides additional context on exploratory analyses and deviations."
  },
  "failure_handling[0].failure_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The failure type 'Data-Related Failures' is an exact match with the reference document, which discusses data differences and potential coding issues."

  "failure_handling[0].suggestions": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The suggestions for handling data-related failures are an exact match with the reference, which recommends verifying variable definitions and units."
  },
  "failure_handling[1].failure_type": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The failure type 'Method/Alignment Failures' is an exact match with the reference document, which discusses deviations in methods and controls."
  },

      "description": "The study employs two-way fixed-effects regression models on a country-year panel of 18 OECD nations (1970\u20132003) to test the impact of national affluence, unbalanced productivity growth, and globalization on manufacturing employment. Models correct for serial correlation, spatial correlation, and heteroscedasticity using GLS (xtgls in Stata) and include lagged explanatory variables. Separate equations estimate indirect effects of trade on affluence and productivity growth.",

      "summary": "All three factors\u2014rising national affluence, unbalanced productivity growth, and globalization\u2014significantly contributed to deindustrialization in advanced economies between 1970 and 2003. Affluence exerted the strongest influence, accounting for about one-third of the decline in manufacturing employment. North-South trade explained roughly one-quarter, while unbalanced productivity growth explained a little over one-seventh. Foreign direct investment was not a significant driver. Imports from the South displaced more jobs than exports created, and nonlinear relationships were found for both affluence and productivity growth.",

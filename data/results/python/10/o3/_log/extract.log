The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

The study in question, conducted by Christopher Kollmeyer and published in the *American Journal of Sociology* in May 2009, investigates the reasons behind the deindustrialization observed in economically advanced countries over recent decades. The research specifically examines three primary factors that contribute to this trend: consumer affluence, productivity growth within the manufacturing sector, and globalization.

**Methodology:**
Kollmeyer uses two-way fixed-effects regression models and panel data from 18 OECD countries, spanning the years 1970 to 2003. The countries included are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. 

**Key Explanatory Factors:**

1. **Consumer Affluence:** As consumer wealth increases, spending shifts from manufactured goods towards services. This change in demand affects the employment share in manufacturing.

2. **Productivity Growth:** Manufacturing sectors typically experience higher productivity growth compared to services, often due to labor-saving technologies. This enables maintaining or increasing output with fewer workers, thereby reducing employment in this sector.

3. **Globalization:** Increased trade, especially between developed (North) and developing (South) countries, facilitates outsourcing, reducing manufacturing jobs in economically advanced countries. Globalization impacts deindustrialization both directly by allowing offshoring and indirectly by influencing domestic market dynamics.

**Results:**
- **Affluence** emerged as the most significant factor, indicating that as consumer wealth increased, their purchasing priorities shifted, profoundly impacting manufacturing employment.
- **Productivity Growth** contributes to deindustrialization but is not the sole driver. Nevertheless, rapid increases in manufacturing productivity relative to services lead to a reduction in manufacturing jobs.
- **Globalization** also plays a crucial role, primarily through direct effects of trade patterns and indirectly by reinforcing existing trends towards affluence and productivity improvements.
  
**Conclusions:**
The analysis confirms that all three factors contribute to deindustrialization, with rising consumer affluence being the most influential. This study underscores the importance of considering multiple factors and their interactions when examining socioeconomic transformations such as deindustrialization. The findings demonstrate that the decline in manufacturing employment is a multifaceted issue driven by both domestic and international economic dynamics. The study fills a gap in existing literature by simultaneously testing these factors and considering indirect channels of influence, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of deindustrialization in the late 20th century.

The document discusses the concept of deindustrialization, emphasizing how rising affluence affects demand for agricultural products, manufactured goods, and services. Key findings from Clark (1957) highlight that as income per capita increases, demand for agriculture decreases, manufactured goods initially increase but eventually decline in favor of services due to their durable nature. Recent empirical studies, using statistical models, confirm the inverted U-shaped effect of income on manufacturing employment; it increases with income in low- to moderate-income nations but decreases in affluent nations, promoting a shift towards services.

The impact of economic globalization on deindustrialization is further examined, highlighting a shift from the traditional international division of labor to a "new international division of labor," where advanced economies (North) focus on high-skilled activities while developing countries (South) handle low-skilled manufacturing. This shift, facilitated by cost-reducing strategies and technological advancements, has been supported by various empirical studies, although there are differing magnitudes regarding the decline of unskilled labor demand in the North.

The document also critiques previous research methodologies for omitted variable bias and underexploration of indirect globalization effects. It suggests that global trade could indirectly influence deindustrialization by increasing Northern affluence and promoting unbalanced productivity growth. The proposed research aims to test all explanations for deindustrialization using advanced quantitative methods, focusing on variables such as per capita income and manufacturing employment.

Key metrics include relative manufacturing employment as the dependent variable, represented by the manufacturing workforce percentage. The data comes from the OECD's STAN database. The research strategy involves testing a hypothesis where North-South trade affects both affluence and productivity growth in the North, depicted in a conceptual path diagram. This comprehensive analysis seeks to address the limitations of earlier studies by considering all factors simultaneously to yield more accurate findings on the determinants of deindustrialization.

The study explores the factors contributing to deindustrialization in 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2003, using a panel data approach. The key methodologies implemented involve various explanatory variables and statistical models to capture the dynamics of economic transitions.

1. **Explanatory Variables**:
   - **Per Capita Income**: The analysis suggests that the impact of per capita income on manufacturing employment declines at higher national affluence levels.
   - **Unbalanced Productivity Growth**: Calculated by the difference in real value added per worker between manufacturing and service sectors, accumulated since 1970. A squared term is included to capture the diminishing effects at high levels of productivity growth.
   - **North-South Trade**: Disaggregated into imports from and exports to the South (defined with adjustments to OECD regions), measuring their effects as percentages of GDP.
   - **North-North Trade**: Similarly disaggregated, focusing on trade between Northern countries, also expressed as a percentage of GDP.
   - **Net Outflow of Direct Investment**: Measures the net value of investment flows, indicating potential impacts on domestic manufacturing jobs.

2. **Control Variables**:
   - The primary control variable, unemployment, addresses the "failure effect," where economic imbalances may prevent the service sector from absorbing displaced manufacturing workers.

3. **Statistical Methodology**:
   - Using panel data provides a two-dimensional analysis across countries and years. This requires addressing potential heterogeneity bias through fixed-effects (FE) models, which are suited for capturing temporal changes and controlling unmeasured country-specific factors. The FE model was favored over the random-effects (RE) model due to its suitability for the mostly inclusive dataset of advanced economies and the correlation between country-specific effects and independent variables, validated by the Hausman test.

4. **Two-Way Fixed-Effects Model**:
   - This model accounts for unmeasured time-specific effects, such as global economic slumps or outsourcing trends, by introducing dummy variables for each five-year period, with 1970–74 as the reference.

Overall, the study concluded that structural factors, such as productivity differences between sectors and the influence of international trade and investment, significantly contribute to the observed patterns of deindustrialization. The inclusion of detailed regional trade classifications and a robust statistical model framework allows a comprehensive analysis of these complex economic dynamics.

In this study, various complications associated with panel data were identified, including serial correlation, spatial correlation, and groupwise heteroscedasticity, as determined through postestimation tests in Stata. Specifically, the Wooldridge test indicated first-order serial correlation, a modified Breusch-Pagan test indicated spatial correlation, and a modified Wald test indicated groupwise heteroscedasticity.

To address these issues, a two-way fixed-effects (FE) model was fitted using generalized least squares (GLS) through Stata's xtgls command. This approach controls for the identified correlations and heteroscedasticity but does not provide R-squared measures. Further refinement of the model involved the Hadi robust outlier detection algorithm, which identified and led to the exclusion of seven outliers, notably affecting countries like Norway (1999-2003) and Belgium (1998-99). Additionally, explanatory variables were lagged by one year to account for temporal delays in cause-and-effect relationships.

For modeling indirect effects on deindustrialization, a set of three equations was used:
1. Equation 1a involves relative manufacturing employment (RME) and various factors such as national affluence (NA), unbalanced productivity growth (UPG), and trade variables.
2. Equation 1b models national affluence (NA) with certain trade variables and control variables (CV).
3. Equation 1c represents unbalanced productivity growth (UPG) similarly.

Despite potential feedback loops and correlation issues in multi-equation models, instrument variable (IV) estimation was deemed unnecessary as the model had unidirectional causation. Moreover, the Breusch-Pagan test indicated only mild correlation between the disturbance terms in equations 1b and 1c, allowing each equation to be estimated separately with the FE-GLS estimator.

Results for domestic causes of deindustrialization showed:
- A nonlinear relationship between national affluence and manufacturing employment was identified, with coefficients for national affluence (positive), national affluence squared (negative), and national affluence cubed (positive), suggesting different phases in the relationship depending on per capita income levels.
- A similar nonlinear relationship was found for unbalanced productivity growth, with corresponding positive and negative coefficients.

Three regression models reported in Table 1 showed statistically significant effects:
- Model 1: Domestic Causes – national affluence and unbalanced productivity growth were significant factors in manufacturing employment changes.
- Model 2: Global Causes – imports/exports to/from the South and North significantly affected deindustrialization.
- Model 3: Combined Causes – combined domestic and global factors retained significance in altering manufacturing employment.

Overall, the study underscores the complex interrelations influencing deindustrialization and highlights the methodological approaches necessary to accurately capture these dynamics. The research demonstrated robustness by also applying a 3SLS approach and observing consistent substantive meanings across different estimation methods.

This text outlines an analysis of the factors contributing to deindustrialization, focusing on models of economic relationships and their impact on manufacturing employment across 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2003. Here are the key points:

**Methodologies and Models:**

- Three models are used to analyze deindustrialization: 
  - **Model 1:** Examines the role of increasingly affluent consumers and unbalanced productivity growth, suggesting that these factors slow down as countries develop economically.
  - **Model 2:** Focuses on global economic factors, particularly North-South trade and foreign direct investment (FDI). It suggests North-South trade displaces more jobs than it creates in the North. FDI was found not to be significantly linked to deindustrialization.
  - **Model 3:** Incorporates all variables except FDI, offering comprehensive insights into both direct and indirect effects. It refines the understanding of North-South trade’s impact, indicating a lesser displacement of jobs compared to the previous model.

**Specific Metrics:**

- Coefficients for North-South trade indicate that imports from the South displace more jobs compared to exports creating jobs. The ratio shifted from imports displacing four times as many jobs in Model 2 to three times in Model 3.
- The Wald χ² statistic is very high across the models, indicating strong model significance.

**Results:**

- National affluence is found to be the largest contributor to deindustrialization, accounting for over 34% of the decline in manufacturing employment.
- North-South trade accounts for around 24%, while unbalanced productivity growth accounts for just over 15%. 
- The study contends that while North-South trade is consistent with prior literature, the role of productivity growth is less influential than previously believed.
- Indirect effects analysis shows that not considering these underestimates the influence of North-South trade and overestimates the role of productivity growth and national affluence.

**Conclusions:**

- Rising consumer affluence, uneven productivity growth, and expanded trade with developing economies are substantial determinants of deindustrialization.
- The role of FDI in deindustrialization is less significant than anticipated, as it often circulates within developed countries rather than contributing to job displacement in manufacturing. 
- Indirect effects, particularly from global trade, amplify the economic outcomes contributing to deindustrialization.

The study offers a refined perspective on deindustrialization, emphasizing the complex influence of global trade and economic development on manufacturing sectors.

The article investigates the causes behind the widespread deindustrialization in economically advanced countries over recent decades. It evaluates three primary factors: rising consumer affluence, faster productivity growth in manufacturing compared to other economic sectors, and increased trade with low-wage countries. Using data from 18 OECD countries between 1970 and 2003, the study finds that each factor significantly contributes to deindustrialization. It notes that global trade influences employment patterns both directly and indirectly, but attributes the largest effect to increasing affluence in Northern countries.

The study challenges previous conclusions, specifically those of Rowthorn and colleagues, who had emphasized unbalanced productivity growth as the leading cause of deindustrialization. The findings suggest that affluence and productivity were inaccurately combined into one measure in earlier research, overlooking their individual impacts. Additionally, the research identifies globalization's substantial role, attributing over 24% of OECD countries' deindustrialization and 30% in the U.S. to North-South trade. The paper also highlights an unexplained period effect accounting for 13% of deindustrialization, possibly due to common cross-national phenomena like human capital upgrades or outsourcing, which could be related to the evolving organizational structures in manufacturing firms.

The study utilizes a FE-3SLS regression model to estimate effects on relative manufacturing employment, finding significant impacts from national affluence, productivity growth, and trade variables. For instance, national affluence and productivity growth displayed substantial direct and indirect influences on employment. The research suggests that further investigations should explore the interconnectedness of globalization and outsourcing in shaping employment trends, with organizational restructuring potentially responsible for a significant portion of the observed decline in manufacturing jobs.

The document is a comprehensive bibliography covering various aspects of economic globalization, industrialization, deindustrialization, labor market dynamics, and global trade. Key works include Barry Bluestone's analysis of deindustrialization in the U.S. economy, David Brady and Ryan Denniston's study on globalization's impact on affluent democracies, and Emmanuel's exploration of unequal exchange in trade. Manuel Castells discusses the rise of the network society, while Peter Dicken focuses on shifts in the global economy. 

Specific studies, such as those by Krugman and Lawrence, investigate the relationship between trade, jobs, and wages, providing insights into manufacturing trade changes over time (1978–1995) by Kucera and Milberg. Discussions on the productivity rebound and its implications for manufacturing employment are addressed by Nordhaus. 

Analyses of trade and employment impacts due to import competition in U.S. manufacturing are presented by Revenga, while Saeger questions the reality of globalization and deindustrialization within OECD countries. 

Rowthorn and Coutts analyze deindustrialization's impact on balance of payments, and specific methodologies in estimating campaign spending effects on election outcomes are studied by Gerber. The document reflects a broad array of methodologies, data analyses, and theoretical frameworks that have shaped the understanding of these complex economic phenomena.

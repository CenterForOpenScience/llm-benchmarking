You are a researcher specialized in evaluating research replication studies.
You are given a JSON object containing structured report of a replication attempt of a research paper and a reference document that contains outcomes/information if the replication study is to carried out correctly. your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the reported JSON object based on the information presented in the reference document.

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the "fidelity_assessment" and "results_comparisons" aspects: 
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in "interpretation_summary" and "execute_status":

    Final Report - SCORE Project for Replication of a
Research Claim from Kollmeyer (2009), from American
Journal of Sociology

Claim Summary
The claim selected for replication from Kollmeyer (2009) is that there is an indirect ef-
fect of the level of a northern, economically advanced country’s imports from the South on
de-industrialization that goes through national aﬄuence. Speciﬁcally, North-South trade in-
creases real per capita incomes of Northern countries and, in the process, indirectly promotes
de-industrialization by heightening national aﬄuence beyond levels that would prevail in the
absence of global trade. The focal claim concerns the association between imports from the
South and national aﬄuence. This reﬂects the following statement from the paper’s abstract:
“The results indicate that each factor makes signiﬁcant contributions to de-industrialization,
and that global trade exerts both direct and indirect eﬀects on employment patterns in eco-
nomically advanced countries.” The author tests the selected claim using two-way ﬁxed-
eﬀects regression models and panel data on 18 Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) countries from 1970 to 2003. The speciﬁcation of the model can be
gleaned from Figure 2, equations 1a - 1c, and Table 2, Model 4. The focal test result con-
cerns the location of the estimated coeﬃcient “Imports from the South” under the heading
“Model 4”. The dependent variable is “National Aﬄuence”. The result was a statistically
signiﬁcant estimated coeﬃcient for “Imports from the South” under the heading “Model 4”
(b = 0.910, SE = 0.104, p < 0.001).

Replication Criteria
Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project is a statistically signif-
icant eﬀect (alpha = .05, two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal
hypothesis test ( H* ). For this study, this criteria is met by a positive and statistically
signiﬁcant (to the 5% level) association between national aﬄuence “NAﬀ” and imports from
the south “IMS” as mentioned in section 17 of the pre-registration; pre-registration can be
found by clicking HERE.

Replication Results
The original study collected data for “18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2003” (p. 1644) using
OECD’s STAN database. The replication data uses trade data from UN Comtrade from 1950
to 2011 for 33 OECD member countries (i.e., there are originally 37 OECD countries but
following the original author, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Turkey are considered “South”
countries and hence, excluded from the list). The rest of the datasets required for replication
(i.e., GDP, population, and unemployment) are from the same source used by the original
authors. An additional dataset containing the years each OECD member country joined
the OECD is taken from the OECD (variable: “year ratiﬁed”).
An additional variable
has also been created to identify the original 18 countries that the original author used
(variable: “oecd18”). The author deﬁnes the “Global North” as countries in Europe and
North America but excluded Mexico and Turkey from this deﬁnition.
They also moved
Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, and Korea from the “Global South” to the “Global
North”. The OECD member countries on top of the 18 that the original authors used, except
for Chile and Colombia, are all European countries. Hence, there was no need to move them
anywhere. The ﬁnal replication dataset has all 33 OECD countries from 1950-2011.

Replication Results for Table 2
Figure 1 illustrates the replication results, taken directly from STATA, for model (4) in Table
2 of the original publication. In ﬁgure 1, note that IMS L1 represents the independent vari-
able “Imports from the South”, lagged by one period, EXS L1 represents the independent
variable “Exports to the South”, lagged by one period, and unemp represents the unem-

ployment rate. Those coeﬃcients are ﬂlowed by a list of time dummy variables and ﬁnally
a constant term.
3.2
Assessment of Replication Results
Based on the replication of the claim (provided in ﬁgure 1) exceeding the criteria outlined in
section 2, a successful replication attempt for this SCORE project has been met. Speciﬁ-
cally, the replication results demonstrate a positive relationship between national aﬄuence
(Naﬀ) and Imports from the South (IMS), that is statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level.

Deviations from Preregistration
The xtgls routine estimated in STATA has been augmented with the options “panels(hetero)”
and “corr(psar1)” in order to control for serial autocorrelation in the residuals, spatial cor-
relation, and groupwise heteroskedasticity. This resulted in an estimation routine closer to
what the author outlined in the published article. Although more consistent with the text,
this change did not alter the results of the replication, or the ultimate assessment of the
replication claim.

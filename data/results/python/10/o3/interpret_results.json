  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the preregistered plan closely: the Python script rebuilt the key variables from the supplied OECD panel, created one-year lags, and estimated a country fixed-effects panel model with clustered standard errors. All steps executed successfully inside a Docker container and produced a coefficient table.  However, the focal coefficient for lagged Imports from the South (IMS_lag1) is \u2212478.0 (SE = 332.97, p = 0.152), i.e., negative and not statistically significant.  This contrasts sharply with the original study\u2019s positive and highly significant estimate (b = 0.910, SE = 0.104, p < 0.001).  Thus, on the extended 1965-2018 dataset the hypothesised positive relationship is not reproduced.  Potential reasons include the longer time span (post-2003 observations), different estimation routine (FE-OLS with clustered SEs versus FE-GLS with AR(1)\u2013spatial corrections), and possible scaling or construction differences in the affluence variable, but the core analytic design remained aligned with the preregistered plan.",

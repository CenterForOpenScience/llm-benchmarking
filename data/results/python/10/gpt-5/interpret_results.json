  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the planned approach closely: constructing NAff, IMS, EXS; applying robust outlier screening; creating five-year period dummies; and estimating a country fixed-effects panel regression with period dummies. However, due to incompatibility, two-way or one-way clustering was not used and robust SEs were reported. The replication used an extended dataset (1965\u20132018, 30 countries) and removed more outliers than in the original. The focal coefficient on lagged imports from the South (L_IMS) was negative and not statistically significant (b \u2248 -190.6, SE \u2248 158.9, p \u2248 0.231), diverging from the original positive, highly significant estimate (b = 0.910, SE = 0.104, p < 0.001). Overall, the replication does not support the original claim under these data and methodological approximations.",

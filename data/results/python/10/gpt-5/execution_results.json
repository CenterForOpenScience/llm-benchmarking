Created a Python translation of the Stata do-file (KMYR__py.py), which: loaded finaldata_noNA.csv; constructed NAff = gdp/pop; IMS = totalimport/(gdp*10000); EXS = totalexport/(gdp*10000); removed outliers using MinCovDet (as an approximation to Hadi), flagging 118 and retaining 666 rows; created five-year period dummies; computed within-country lags for IMS, EXS, and unemployment; and estimated a country fixed-effects PanelOLS with period dummies. Two-way and country-only clustering were incompatible with the model data, so the model used robust SEs. Execution completed successfully, producing a regression summary and estimates. The focal coefficient on lagged IMS was negative and not statistically significant, diverging from the original positive significant result. The dataset covers 1965\u20132018, which differs from the original 1970\u20132003 window.",

The focal test result concerns the location of the estimated coefficient “Imports from the South”. The dependent variable is national affluence. The result was a statistically significant estimated coefficient for “Imports from the South” (b=.910,SE=.104,p<.001)

Imports from the South will be positively associated with national affluence.

Thought: I gathered the preregistration details, execution results, and the produced outputs. The focal hypothesis is that imports from the South positively affect national affluence. The executed replication implemented the planned FE model with period dummies, but used robust SEs instead of clustered SEs, approximated Hadi outlier removal with MinCovDet, and used an extended time window and more countries than the original. The produced estimates show a negative, non-significant coefficient on lagged imports from the South, contradicting the original positive, highly significant effect. The outputs in replication_estimates.json confirm the reported results. I can now synthesize the interpretation.

Answer: {
  "interpretation_summary": "The replication followed the planned approach closely: constructing NAff, IMS, EXS; applying robust outlier screening; creating five-year period dummies; and estimating a country fixed-effects panel regression with period dummies. However, due to incompatibility, two-way or one-way clustering was not used and robust SEs were reported. The replication used an extended dataset (1965–2018, 30 countries) and removed more outliers than in the original. The focal coefficient on lagged imports from the South (L_IMS) was negative and not statistically significant (b ≈ -190.6, SE ≈ 158.9, p ≈ 0.231), diverging from the original positive, highly significant estimate (b = 0.910, SE = 0.104, p < 0.001).

2026-01-11 11:28:10,196 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Execute using Python.
- If the original code is incompatible with the data, rewrite the code to Python so that it is compatible. 
- If replication_info.json points to a non-.py entrypoint, create/complete the Python translations (keeping originals unchanged),
  create a single Python entrypoint, and update replication_info.json to that .py entrypoint.
- If it fails, fix the Python rewrite / deps (don’t switch back to the original language).

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

**Phases of Execution:**

PHASE 1: BUILD ENVIRONMENT
1. `orchestrator_generate_dockerfile`: Creates _runtime/Dockerfile from replication_info.json.
2. `orchestrator_build_image`: Builds the image.
   * IF BUILD FAILS: Read the error log. It usually means a missing system package or R/Python library. Edit `replication_info.json` to add the missing dependency, regenerate the Dockerfile, and rebuild.

PHASE 2: PREPARE RUNTIME
3. `orchestrator_run_container`: Mounts the code and data and starts the container.
4. `orchestrator_plan` & `orchestrator_preview_entry`: Verify what will run.

PHASE 3: HUMAN APPROVAL (Strict Check)
5. Before running the actual analysis code, you MUST Ask the human:
   Action: ask_human_input: "Ready to execute command: <COMMAND>. Approve? (yes/no)"
   * If they say "no", stop the container and fill the output JSON with status "cancelled".
   * If they say "yes", proceed to Phase 4.

PHASE 4: EXECUTE & DEBUG
6. `orchestrator_execute_entry`: Runs the code.
   * IF EXECUTION FAILS (exit_code != 0): 
     - Read the `stderr` in the observation.
     - Identify if it is a code error or missing library.
     - Use `write_file` to fix the script or `replication_info.json`.
     - If you changed dependencies, you must go back to Phase 1 (Rebuild).
     - If you only changed code, you can retry `orchestrator_execute_entry`.

PHASE 5: FINALIZE
7. `orchestrator_stop_container`: Cleanup.
8. Parse `execution_result.json` and output the Answer in the following required JSON schema.

The focal test result concerns the location of the estimated coefficient “Imports from the South”. The dependent variable is national affluence. The result was a statistically significant estimated coefficient for “Imports from the South” (b=.910,SE=.104,p<.001)

[HYPOTHESIS]
Imports from the South will be positively associated with national affluence.

Thought: We successfully built the Docker image, created a Python translation of the Stata do-file, executed the analysis in the container after human approval, and collected outputs. Two-way and one-way clustering were not compatible with the PanelOLS call due to cluster shape requirements, so the code fell back to robust SEs. The focal coefficient on Imports from the South (lagged) is negative and not statistically significant, which does not replicate the original positive significant effect. Below is the final report.

Answer: {
  "execution_summary": "Built a Python 3.10 environment with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, linearmodels, statsmodels, and scipy. Created a Python translation of the Stata do-file (KMYR__py.py), which: loaded finaldata_noNA.csv; constructed NAff = gdp/pop; IMS = totalimport/(gdp*10000); EXS = totalexport/(gdp*10000); removed outliers using MinCovDet (as an approximation to Hadi), flagging 118 and retaining 666 rows; created five-year period dummies; computed within-country lags for IMS, EXS, and unemployment; and estimated a country fixed-effects PanelOLS with period dummies. Two-way and country-only clustering were incompatible with the model data, so the model used robust SEs. Execution completed successfully, producing a regression summary and estimates. The focal coefficient on lagged IMS was negative and not statistically significant, diverging from the original positive significant result. The dataset covers 1965–2018, which differs from the original 1970–2003 window.",

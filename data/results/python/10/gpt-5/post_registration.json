      "description": "The study analyzes deindustrialization across 18 OECD countries (1970\u20132003) using two-way fixed-effects panel regressions. The dependent variable is relative manufacturing employment. Key predictors include national affluence (GDP per capita with higher-order terms), unbalanced productivity growth (manufacturing minus services, cumulative since 1970), and globalization metrics (North\u2013South trade flows, North\u2013North trade, FDI). Models address serial/spatial correlation and heteroscedasticity via GLS; all covariates are lagged one year. Outliers are removed using a robust algorithm, and separate equations assess indirect effects on affluence and productivity.",

        "Compile globalization measures: North\u2013South imports and exports, North\u2013North trade (scaled to GDP); FDI net outflows; and unemployment rate as a control (sources implied to be OECD; specific series not stated).",

        "Lag all explanatory variables by one year to reflect delayed effects.",

      "summary": "Affluence is the strongest driver of deindustrialization: as incomes rise, manufacturing employment first increases and then declines, with the net effect at higher affluence being negative. Faster productivity growth in manufacturing relative to services reduces manufacturing employment. Globalization contributes via trade: imports from the South displace more manufacturing jobs than exports to the South create; imports from the North also negatively affect employment. FDI shows no significant relationship. Estimated contributions attribute roughly one-third of deindustrialization to rising affluence, with additional shares from North\u2013South trade and unbalanced productivity growth. Domestic factors account for over half of the deindustrialization observed.",

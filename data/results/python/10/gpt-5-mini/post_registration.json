      "description": "The study uses panel regression analyses with two-way fixed effects on a panel of 18 OECD countries (1970\u20132003) to simultaneously test three proposed causes of deindustrialization: rising national affluence, unbalanced productivity growth (manufacturing vs. services), and globalization (trade and FDI). The authors add nonlinear terms (squared and cubed) for income and productivity to capture nonlinearity, disaggregate trade by partner regions (North vs. South) and by direction (imports vs. exports), apply period (five-year) dummies, test for panel data issues (serial correlation, spatial correlation, heteroskedasticity), detect and remove outliers (Hadi algorithm), lag explanatory variables by one year, and estimate using fixed-effects generalized least squares (FE-GLS). They also estimate system models (FE-3SLS / 3SLS) to assess direct and indirect effects and validate robustness.",

      "summary": "All three hypothesized factors\u2014rising national affluence, unbalanced productivity growth, and globalization (particularly imports from low-wage 'South' countries)\u2014significantly contribute to deindustrialization in advanced economies. Rising consumer affluence is identified as the largest single contributor. Imports from the South have a sizable negative effect on domestic manufacturing employment, larger in magnitude than the positive effects of exports to the South. The paper finds nonlinear (cubic) relationships for affluence and productivity growth with relative manufacturing employment. Decomposition attributes roughly 34% of the decline to rising affluence, 24% to North\u2013South trade (direct effects), over 15% to unbalanced productivity growth, about 15% to unemployment, and roughly 13% to period effects. Robustness checks using FE-3SLS/3SLS corroborate main findings.",

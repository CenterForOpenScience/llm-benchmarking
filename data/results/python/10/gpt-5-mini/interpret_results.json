  "interpretation_summary": "I examined the preregistration/post-registration materials, the planned replication steps, and the executed outputs. The replication script executed successfully and produced coefficient output files. Key comparisons focused on the focal test: the coefficient on lagged Imports-from-the-South (L_IMS) in a model predicting National Affluence (NAff). Variable construction largely followed the original .do (NAff = gdp/pop; IMS computed per .do), but the executed estimation deviated from the original FE-GLS approach: the replication used OLS with country dummies and 5-year dummies and simplified outlier removal. The replication estimate for L_IMS is -478.012 (SE = 107.693, p \u2248 1.05e-05, N = 752), which is negative and highly significant \u2014 opposite in sign and hugely different in magnitude from the original reported positive effect (b = 0.910, SE = 0.104, p < .001). Thus the executed replication does not support the original focal claim under the implemented analysis, but several methodological and possible data-scaling differences limit direct comparability.",

The replication reconstructed the same variables and estimated a model that includes the same regressors and fixed-effect controls (country fixed effects implemented via dummies and 5\u2011year period dummies), matching the planned model form in broad strokes. Major methodological differences remain: the original paper used FE-GLS (xtgls) with corrections for serial and cross-sectional correlation and heteroskedasticity, while the replication used plain OLS with nonrobust standard errors. Outlier detection was simplified (Hadi in original vs a removed/approximated method during execution). Time coverage in the executed run used the provided CSV (final N = 752) rather than strictly restricting to the original 1970\u20132003 period in the main comparison (the replication plan did list this as a robustness check but the primary executed result used the full/available sample).",

(2) Durbin-Watson \u2248 0.674 indicates serial correlation in residuals, consistent with the original's diagnosis that panel corrections were required; this supports implementing FE-GLS or robust panel-corrected SEs before trusting p-values. (3) The residual diagnostics (large Jarque-Bera, skewness, kurtosis) indicate non-normality and potential outliers that should be handled consistently with original approach. (4) Recommended priority actions: run the original Stata KMYR.do in Stata (to match estimator, outlier removal, and corrections exactly), or (if Stata is unavailable) implement in Python the same FE-GLS/panel corrections and Hadi outlier detection; also run the restricted 1970\u20132003 sample. (5) After alignment, compare the focal coefficient sign/magnitude and standard errors; if discrepancy persists, investigate sample-by-sample influence (influence diagnostics) and possible variable construction mismatches."

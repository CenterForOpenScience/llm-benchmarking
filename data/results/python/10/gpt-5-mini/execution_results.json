  "execution_summary": "I generated a Dockerfile from replication_info.json, built a Docker image, and ran the Python replication script (replication_data/KMYR__py.py) inside the container. During execution I resolved import errors and path mismatches by: (1) pinning Python package versions in replication_info.json and regenerating the Dockerfile; (2) removing sklearn-based outlier detection (to avoid missing dependency) and simplifying outlier handling; (3) adjusting DATA_PATH and output paths to use the container workspace (/workspace) and copying outputs to /app/data. After fixing a small syntax error introduced during edits, the script ran successfully. The primary focal regression NAff ~ L_IMS + L_EXS + L_unemp + country FE + 5-year dummies was estimated on the provided dataset; final estimation sample size was 752. The focal coefficient L_IMS was estimated as -478.012 (SE = 107.693, p \u2248 1.05e-05), which is negative and statistically significant, differing in sign and magnitude from the original reported positive effect (original: b = 0.910, SE = 0.104). The replication used OLS with dummy fixed effects rather than the original FE-GLS, and outlier detection was simplified; these methodological differences likely affect comparability.",

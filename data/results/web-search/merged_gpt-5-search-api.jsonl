([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/13/4899?utm_source=openai))  \n   - The paper describes methodology, sample (n = 1242), and summary statistics. It may list whether the raw responses are shared or how to request them.  \n   - Checking the preprint is crucial to find whether the raw data are publicly archived (e.g., via OSF or Dataverse).\n\n2. **Collection of Surveys on the Corona Crisis**: This portal lists Gerhold\u2019s survey among others. ([c-m-l.net](https://www.c-m-l.net/en/2020/04/09/collection-of-surveys-on-the-corona-crisis/?utm_source=openai))  \n   - However, it states \u201cRaw data available: No.\u201d ([c-m-l.net](https://www.c-m-l.net/en/2020/04/09/collection-of-surveys-on-the-corona-crisis/?utm_source=openai))  \n   - It does link to \u201cPreprint on PsyArXiv\u201d and \u201cRunning survey [German]\u201d. The \u201crunning survey\u201d may provide questionnaire wording (helpful for verifying question items), but likely not raw data.\n\n3. **Alternate survey: F\u00fchrer et al. (2020)** \u2013 *COVID-19: Knowledge, risk perception and strategies for handling the pandemic*. Representative of Germany, March-April 2020. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7294294/?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Similar timeframe. If this includes \u201cworried about COVID-19 in general\u201d with gender breakdown, it may substitute.\n\n4. **Alternate survey: L\u00fcdecke & von dem Knesebeck (2020)** \u2013 Germany protective behavior and demographic differences including gender. ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.572561/full?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Might have related items though may not have *exactly* \u201cworried about COVID-19 in general.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations\n\n- The **original raw dataset** of Gerhold\u2019s survey is *missing from public archives*, at least per current search results. The portal states \u201cRaw data available: No\u201d for that survey. ([c-m-l.net](https://www.c-m-l.net/en/2020/04/09/collection-of-surveys-on-the-corona-crisis/?utm_source=openai))  \n- The **analysis code** (e.g. scripts in R/Stata) is also not found.\n\nTo **replicate** the claim (i.e. test gender differences in \u201cworry\u201d exactly as defined), you need:\n\n- The question wording for \u201cThe COVID-19 worries me\u201d (as used in the survey) and its Likert scale coding. (These are provided in the paper.) ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.572561/full?utm_source=openai))  \n- Raw data broken down by gender to compute percentages (\u2265 \u201cagree\u201d category) and test significance.\n\nSince original data/code are unavailable, to replicate using a **new data source** we should:\n\n- Identify a Germany-representative survey conducted around the same time (March 2020) that includes a question \u201cworry about COVID-19 in general\u201d with a 5-point Likert scale, and that has gender breakdown.\n\nFrom our search:\n\n- **F\u00fchrer et al. (2020)** might have such items. We need to check whether that item is present and if percentages are reported by gender. If so, one could approximate or recompute the comparison.\n\n- Alternatively, the **COSMO Germany** survey (COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring) includes repeated measures of risk perception / fear / worry, with items likely analogous. However, search didn\u2019t reveal a publicly available raw dataset for that. ([c-m-l.net](https://www.c-m-l.net/en/2020/04/09/collection-of-surveys-on-the-corona-crisis/?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can look deeper (e.g. contact repository maintainers or search German data archives) to see if the Gerhold data/code can be obtained, or locate a data source that *exactly* matches for replication. Do you want me to try that?"

It includes both the household and village questionnaires as well as technical documentation needed to recreate variables such as agricultural income, caste, land ownership, and village-level dominance. ([microdata.worldbank.org](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/276/related_citations?utm_source=openai))  \n- The **ICPSR project (113777)** holds the replication data (\u201cAEJApp-2009-0289\u2010data\u201d), which is the data package associated with Anderson\u2019s paper. It includes the cleaned data ready to reproduce tables. ([openicpsr.org](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113777/version/V1/view?utm_source=openai))  \n- The AEA article page provides a direct link to the replication package (\u201cReplication Package\u201d under \u201cAdditional Materials\u201d) for the paper. This likely includes code and sometimes do-files depending on what the author provided. ([aeaweb.org](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fapp.3.1.239&utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n### What is missing or not explicitly found\n\n- The original code (e.g. Stata .do files or R scripts) used by Anderson to generate all estimation tables (OLS, IV, interactions with \u201cLow-caste villages\u201d, etc.) isn\u2019t clearly available or identifiable in the publicly released archives. That\u2019s critical if one wants exact model specifications, fixed effects implementations, clustering, variable interactions.\n- While the data (both raw and replication\u2010cleaned) seem available, full transparency about all variable constructions (e.g. defining \u201clow caste villages\u201d, being a \u201cwater buyer\u201d, land dominance, instruments) may require reading the documentation and code if present\u2014or reverse engineering from the data.\n\n---\n\n### Closest feasible data sources for replication in a new sample\n\nIf wanting to replicate the hypothesis with **new** or later data (rather than the original 1997-98 sample), one might consider:\n\n- Later waves of **World Bank India LSMS** or **National Sample Survey (NSS)** data that include agricultural income, caste categories, and village identifiers. Need variables on caste, landholding, irrigation (water buyer/seller), village caste dominance.\n- Other regionally focused surveys in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar or in similarly heterogeneous regions (e.g., other states with mix of upper/low castes) with farming and irrigation variables.\n- More recent Census of India village amenities data (e.g., 2011 village amenities census) merged with household surveys that include caste & farming income.\n\nIf you want, I can help locate those newer datasets with similar variables, and also check for public code (if someone has posted it on GitHub) to enable replication."}

([archives.gov](https://www.archives.gov/research/federal-employees/electronic-records-guide.html?utm_source=openai))\n- OPM\u2019s **Employee Surveys** page describes FHCS (and its successor surveys like FEVS) and often provides documentation and sometimes microdata. ([opm.gov](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/employee-surveys/?utm_source=openai))\n- The OPM datasets portal (\u201cData Products\u201d along with FedScope / its replacement Federal Workforce Data site) includes more recent workforce data; though note these are status / separations / employment files rather than attitude surveys like job satisfaction. For replication with a new sample, surveying later FHCS / FEVS data would be useful. ([opm.gov](https://www.opm.gov/data/data-products/?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n### Missing Resource: Code\n\n- I did *not* find a public source for the original statistical code (Stata or otherwise) used in Pitts, Marvel, and Fernandez (2011). Retrieving that would allow exact reproduction. The \u201cmissing\u201d item is likely available via author supplementary materials, journal supplemental files, or by contacting authors.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can try to locate later waves of FHCS / FEVS with the same variables, so you can see if the effect replicates with new data."}

That may require calculation from age-structure distributions in sources like the U.S. Census International Data Base (IDB) or UN Population Prospects.\n- **Code / supplementary code repository** for the paper: I found no public code repository in searches so far. The original description refers to \u201csupplementary material online\u201d but no DOI or link to code was unearthed in my search.\n- **FESE (Flash Eurobarometer)** data: validation dataset used in the paper; no direct public link for the full data for entrepreneurship variables in 2002-2009 turned up; likely requires access via European Commission or GESIS or similar archives.\n\nIf you like, I can try to locate any contacting information or author pages to request code, and also identify very closely matching later-wave data for replication in a more recent period (e.g. GEM post-2010) using identical operational definitions. Would you prefer I gather those?"}

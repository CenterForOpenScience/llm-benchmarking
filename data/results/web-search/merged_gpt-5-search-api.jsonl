([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/13/4899?utm_source=openai))  \n   - The paper describes methodology, sample (n = 1242), and summary statistics. It may list whether the raw responses are shared or how to request them.  \n   - Checking the preprint is crucial to find whether the raw data are publicly archived (e.g., via OSF or Dataverse).\n\n2. **Collection of Surveys on the Corona Crisis**: This portal lists Gerhold\u2019s survey among others. ([c-m-l.net](https://www.c-m-l.net/en/2020/04/09/collection-of-surveys-on-the-corona-crisis/?utm_source=openai))  \n   - However, it states \u201cRaw data available: No.\u201d ([c-m-l.net](https://www.c-m-l.net/en/2020/04/09/collection-of-surveys-on-the-corona-crisis/?utm_source=openai))  \n   - It does link to \u201cPreprint on PsyArXiv\u201d and \u201cRunning survey [German]\u201d. The \u201crunning survey\u201d may provide questionnaire wording (helpful for verifying question items), but likely not raw data.\n\n3. **Alternate survey: F\u00fchrer et al. (2020)** \u2013 *COVID-19: Knowledge, risk perception and strategies for handling the pandemic*. Representative of Germany, March-April 2020. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7294294/?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Similar timeframe. If this includes \u201cworried about COVID-19 in general\u201d with gender breakdown, it may substitute.\n\n4. **Alternate survey: L\u00fcdecke & von dem Knesebeck (2020)** \u2013 Germany protective behavior and demographic differences including gender. ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.572561/full?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Might have related items though may not have *exactly* \u201cworried about COVID-19 in general.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations\n\n- The **original raw dataset** of Gerhold\u2019s survey is *missing from public archives*, at least per current search results. The portal states \u201cRaw data available: No\u201d for that survey. ([c-m-l.net](https://www.c-m-l.net/en/2020/04/09/collection-of-surveys-on-the-corona-crisis/?utm_source=openai))  \n- The **analysis code** (e.g. scripts in R/Stata) is also not found.\n\nTo **replicate** the claim (i.e. test gender differences in \u201cworry\u201d exactly as defined), you need:\n\n- The question wording for \u201cThe COVID-19 worries me\u201d (as used in the survey) and its Likert scale coding. (These are provided in the paper.) ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.572561/full?utm_source=openai))  \n- Raw data broken down by gender to compute percentages (\u2265 \u201cagree\u201d category) and test significance.\n\nSince original data/code are unavailable, to replicate using a **new data source** we should:\n\n- Identify a Germany-representative survey conducted around the same time (March 2020) that includes a question \u201cworry about COVID-19 in general\u201d with a 5-point Likert scale, and that has gender breakdown.\n\nFrom our search:\n\n- **F\u00fchrer et al. (2020)** might have such items. We need to check whether that item is present and if percentages are reported by gender. If so, one could approximate or recompute the comparison.\n\n- Alternatively, the **COSMO Germany** survey (COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring) includes repeated measures of risk perception / fear / worry, with items likely analogous. However, search didn\u2019t reveal a publicly available raw dataset for that. ([c-m-l.net](https://www.c-m-l.net/en/2020/04/09/collection-of-surveys-on-the-corona-crisis/?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can look deeper (e.g. contact repository maintainers or search German data archives) to see if the Gerhold data/code can be obtained, or locate a data source that *exactly* matches for replication. Do you want me to try that?"

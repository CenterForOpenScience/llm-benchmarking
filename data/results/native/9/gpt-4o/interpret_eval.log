You are a researcher specialized in evaluating research replication studies.
You are given a JSON object containing structured report of a replication attempt of a research paper and a reference document that contains outcomes/information if the replication study is to carried out correctly. your task is to score the information (key, value pair) presented in the reported JSON object based on the information presented in the reference document.

=== END OF EXPLANATION OF WHAT EACH FIELD IN THE JSON MEAN ===

Follow the rubrics below for your evaluation of each component in the JSON. The rubric uses a 0-3 scoring scale for all components, where:
- 3: Exact Match – The reported information is identical or nearly identical to the reference in the document. The meaning is preserved completely, with the same level of detail, including all key elements (e.g., variables, relationships, or numerical values). No omissions or additions of unrelate/incorrect information. 
- 2: Mostly Similar – The reported information conveys the same core meaning as the reference, but with different phrasing or structure. Minor details may be omitted, but the essential information is preserved. If the extracted content is a finding that directly supports a hypothesis, consider it equivalent. 
- 1: Loosely Related – The reported information has partial overlap with the reference but includes significant differences, omissions of major details, or additions of unrelated information. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but incomplete or altered.
- 0: No Match – No relevant overlap with the reference, completely incorrect, or missing entirely.
- NA: The reference document does not contain information to evaluate this component/field of the JSON.

Replication attempt to evaluate a claim from Andrews_BritJournPoliSci_2009_Ryq7 
 
Replication team: Esteban Méndez Chacón and Marco Ramljak 
SCORE RR ID: 95my 
OSF Project: https://osf.io/jegqs 
 
Description of generalizability 
Deviations from the original study: 
1. The original study uses the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP), from 1945 to 
1999, and includes the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, 
Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the 
United Kingdom. 
The CMP is also used in the replication; however, more recent years (2000-2019) 
are added to the original sample, and nine more countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech 
Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, and Slovakia. 
2. The original study does not indicate the source for the type of electoral system. In 
the replication, the source is the Comparative Political Data Set (CPDS).  
3. There is a difference of nine extra elections between the reproduction analysis 
(N=284) and the original study (N = 275). The difference can be due to an update of 
the CPM dataset; or because the CPDS dataset includes more elections than the 
source used by the authors.

Claim evaluation 
Single-trace claim 
Coded claim 4 text (original paper): “The authors find that as the number of parties in 
the system increases, party dispersion increases and the effect is statistically significant for 
both policy dimensions (economic policy dimension is selected for the SCORE program) 
(coefficient on log count of parties in system term = 0.39, robust SE clustered by country = 
0.14, coefficient falls within a 95% confidence interval).”

Replication outcome: Simple test 
Inferential criteria: Criteria for a successful replication attempt for the SCORE project is a 
statistically significant effect for the predictor COUNT_PARTIES (alpha = .05, two tailed) in 
the same pattern as the original study on the focal hypothesis test (H*). 
Result: Column (1) of Table R.1 shows that as the log count of parties in the system 
(variable COUNT_PARTIES) increases, party dispersion in the economic dimension 
increases. Coefficient on log count of parties in system term = 0.32, robust SE 
clustered by country = 0.13. The effect is statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 
0.021), two-tailed test. Consequently, this claim was replicated. 
Deviations from the preregistration: None. 
 
Reproduction analysis 
While the previous result is obtained by using all the available observations, a second 
analysis restricted to observations that were used in the original analysis is also performed. 
Reproduction criteria: Criteria for a successful reproduction attempt for the SCORE 
project is a statistically significant effect for the predictor COUNT_PARTIES (alpha = .05, 
two tailed) in the same pattern as the original study on the focal hypothesis test (H*). 
Result: Column (2) of Table R.1 shows that as the log count of parties in the system 
(variable COUNT_PARTIES) increases, party dispersion in the economic dimension 
increases. Coefficient on log count of parties in system term = 0.40, robust SE 
clustered by country = 0.16. The effect is statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 
0.023), two-tailed test. Consequently, the reproduction was successful. 
Deviations from the preregistration: None.

 The R code to clean the CMP and the CPDS datasets. Filename:  
o ANDREWS code.r  
Note that this code also cleans the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), which is a 
dataset proposed by the data finder but not required for the final analysis. 
 The data dictionary for the cleaned CMP and CPDS datasets. Filename:  
o Codebook andrews.xlsx  
 The code for replication and reproduction. Along with the cleaned CMP and CPDS 
datasets, these are the only files required to replicate and reproduce the original 
study. To replicate/reproduce the study, just change the working directory to where 
the data is in your computer and run the files using Stata (the codes were written 
using Stata 16.1). Filenames: 
o Andrews-Money_Replication.do 
o Andrews-Money_Reproduction.do  
 The output from the Stata analyses, available in two formats: smcl (Stata output) 
and a pdf file. Filenames: 
o Andrews-Money_Replication.pdf 
o Andrews-Money_Replication.smcl 
o Andrews-Money_Reproduction.pdf 
o Andrews-Money_Reproduction.smcl 
 
The data sources used in the analysis are the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP) 
(version 2019b) and the Comparative Political Data Set (CPDS) (version 1960-2017). The 
CMP raw data and the cleaned dataset are not uploaded directly to OSF. The data can be 
accessed 
from 
the 
Manifesto 
Project 
website 
(https://manifestoproject.wzb.eu/datasets?archived=yes) provided a brief registration. 
The  CPDS is uploaded to OSF (files: raw.CPDS_1960-2017_Update_2019.xlsx, 
CPDS.final.rds, and CPDS_final.dta), but also it can be downloaded from the CPDS website 
(https://www.cpds-data.org/index.php/data#CPDS).

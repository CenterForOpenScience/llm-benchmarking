2026-01-12 09:32:09,114 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Do NOT translate code to Python.
- If the code is incompatible with the data, you should rewrite the code to make it compatible using the edit_file tool.
- Execute the original-language entrypoint from replication_info.json.
- If it fails, debug in the same language or adjust dependencies.

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

**Phases of Execution:**

PHASE 1: BUILD ENVIRONMENT
1. `orchestrator_generate_dockerfile`: Creates _runtime/Dockerfile from replication_info.json.
2. `orchestrator_build_image`: Builds the image.
   * IF BUILD FAILS: Read the error log. It usually means a missing system package or R/Python library. Edit `replication_info.json` to add the missing dependency, regenerate the Dockerfile, and rebuild.

PHASE 2: PREPARE RUNTIME
3. `orchestrator_run_container`: Mounts the code and data and starts the container.
4. `orchestrator_plan` & `orchestrator_preview_entry`: Verify what will run.

PHASE 3: HUMAN APPROVAL (Strict Check)
5. Before running the actual analysis code, you MUST Ask the human:
   Action: ask_human_input: "Ready to execute command: <COMMAND>. Approve? (yes/no)"
   * If they say "no", stop the container and fill the output JSON with status "cancelled".
   * If they say "yes", proceed to Phase 4.

PHASE 4: EXECUTE & DEBUG
6. `orchestrator_execute_entry`: Runs the code.
   * IF EXECUTION FAILS (exit_code != 0): 
     - Read the `stderr` in the observation.
     - Identify if it is a code error or missing library.
     - Use `write_file` to fix the script or `replication_info.json`.
     - If you changed dependencies, you must go back to Phase 1 (Rebuild).
     - If you only changed code, you can retry `orchestrator_execute_entry`.

PHASE 5: FINALIZE
7. `orchestrator_stop_container`: Cleanup.
8. Parse `execution_result.json` and output the Answer in the following required JSON schema.

Thought: The error persists, indicating that the 'Final replication dataset.rds' file is still not being found in the expected directory within the container. This suggests that the directory might not be mounted correctly, or the script might be looking in the wrong path. I need to verify the path used in the script and ensure it matches the mounted path.

I will read the R script to check the path used for loading the dataset and make any necessary adjustments.

Thought: The R script is attempting to read the dataset using the relative path "Final replication dataset.rds". This suggests that the script expects the dataset to be in the current working directory. Since the working directory is set to `/workspace`, the dataset should be located at `/workspace/Final replication dataset.rds`. However, the dataset is currently located in the `replication_data` directory.

To resolve this, I need to ensure that the dataset is accessible at the expected path. I will adjust the script to use the correct path for the dataset.

Thought: The error persists, indicating that the dataset is still not being found. Despite the adjustments, the `replication_data` directory is not accessible at the expected path within the container. This suggests a persistent issue with the mounting or path configuration.

Thought: The error persists, indicating that the dataset is still not being found. Despite the adjustments, the `replication_data` directory is not accessible at the expected path within the container. This suggests a persistent issue with the mounting or path configuration.

I will verify the current working directory within the container and ensure that the dataset is accessible from there. Additionally, I will check if the dataset is correctly mounted in the container.

Thought: The error persists, indicating that the dataset is still not being found. Despite the adjustments, the `replication_data` directory is not accessible at the expected path within the container. This suggests a persistent issue with the mounting or path configuration.

I will verify the current working directory within the container and ensure that the dataset is accessible from there. Additionally, I will check if the dataset is correctly mounted in the container.

Thought: The error indicates that the `/app` directory does not exist within the container, which suggests that the working directory might not be set correctly. This could be causing the issue with accessing the dataset. I need to ensure that the working directory is set correctly and that the `replication_data` directory is accessible within the container.

I will adjust the Dockerfile to ensure the working directory is set correctly and that the `replication_data` directory is accessible.

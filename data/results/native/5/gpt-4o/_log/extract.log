abstract
Asymptomatic conditions such as hypertension are generally hard to diagnose, absent routine medical
examinations. This is especially problematic in developing countries, where most citizens do not engage
in routine examinations due to limited economic resources. We study the roles of education and indi-
vidual time preferences in asymptomatic disease detection and management. Using discrete choice
models on a sample of 4209 hypertensive Indonesian adults surveyed between November 2007 and April
2008, we ﬁnd that both education and individual time preferences play important roles. However, the
effects are different for people in good health than they are for people in bad health. Education does not
seem to matter for disease detection when respondents are in good general health, and its effects on
disease management vary largely in magnitudes between these groups. In terms of disease detection,
more educated respondents have a higher probability of being diagnosed, but only conditional on being
in poor general health. Time preferences, on the other hand, matter for respondents in good general
health, but the effect is not signiﬁcant for those in bad health. More impatient respondents that are in
good health have a higher probability of being under-diagnosed because they are more likely to forgo
routine physicals. Theﬁndings point to two distinct channels through which education can affect health,
and suggest that different types of policies need to be implemented, in order to reach the entire pop-
ulation. Traditional programs that stimulate education and improve the socio-economic status of in-
dividuals in developing countries are helpful, but they do not address the whole problem. Besides its
more usual positive effects, education can also negatively affect the health of asymptomatic patients,
because it reﬂects a higher opportunity cost of engaging in preventative health screenings.

1. Introduction
A large body of literature studied the link between health and
socio-economic status (SES). In most of these studies, education has
been shown to be the most important determinant of health out-
comes. For a comprehensive literature review on the large empir-
ical evidence seeGrossman (2000, 2006). There are however, large
differences in health outcomes that cannot be accounted by dif-
ferences in SES and there is no consensus regarding the mechanism
through which education affects health. Some argue that education
improves health production efﬁciency (Grossman, 1975), while
others point to other unobservable variables, such as time prefer-
ences, that affect both education and health (Fuchs, 1982).
Incorporating time preferences into models of health behavior
traces its roots back to the discounted utility (DU) model of
Samuelson (1937)which was later shown to be supported by a set
of simple axioms by Koopmans (1960). Fishburn (1970) and
Fishburn and Rubinstein (1982) also provided additional, more
specialized, axiomatic systems for the DU model. One particular
criticism against the DU model, which assumes time preferences to
be exogenous, was brought byBecker and Mulligan (1997)who
argued that time preferences are actually endogenously deter-
mined by factors such as wealth, mortality, or addictions.Frederick
et al. (2002)provide a comprehensive literature review of both the
theoretical considerations and the empirical evidence on inter-
temporal choice and elicited time preferences, with a clear dis-
cussion on the limitations of the existent approaches. Attema
(2012) also provides a more recent literature review, with a clear
focus on the intersection between time preferences and health. We
do not explicitly model time preferences in our paper, nor do we try

to estimate new time preference parameters. Rather we use pre-
viously elicited proxies of time and risk preferences and study their
effects on health, speciﬁcally on hypertension under-diagnosis.
As it relates to health, the time preferences hypothesis was
clearly supported in papers such asLeigh (1983), Kenkel (1991),
Farrell and Fuchs (1982),o rVan Der Pol (2011), yet the causal ef-
fect of education could not be completely eliminated. This causality
was proven among others byLleras-Muney (2005), Adams (2002),
and Arendt (2005). Given the body of evidence, it is likely that
education does have a clear impact on health, but at the same time,
individual time preferences also affect educational attainments and
health. The impact of time preferences on health can be both direct
and indirect (through education) and these effects should not be
ignored. We also would argue that education can have an additional
effect on health through the incentives that it creates in people,
depending on their individual opportunity costs of being sick.
In this paper, we distinguish between two dimensions of health
e health detection (prevention) and health managemente and
analyze the roles of education and time preferences. Most of the
previous literature focused on overall health outcomes, and did not
address these two separate channels. Among the few papers that
tried to partially address this,Axon et al. (2009)showed that in-
dividual time preferences matter in the way people manage their
diseases. More patient people checked their health status more
often and engaged in health promoting activities more often. A
similar correlation was found with respect to education by
Goldman and Smith (2002), with more educated people better
managing their disease and therefore improving more rapidly.
However, the focus in both of these papers is on people with an
established history of disease. There is a very limited literature that
focuses on disease detection, which is a major cause of concern
especially in developing countries. This is especially true for
asymptomatic conditions, such as hypertension.
The World Health Organization (WHO) deﬁnes hypertension as
having elevated blood pressure of 140 mm Hg systolic/90 mm Hg
diastolic or greater. The most common recommendations for hy-
pertension prevention are maintaining a normal body weight,
engaging in moderate physical activity, having a diet rich in fruits,
vegetables, and low-fat dairy, and limiting the consumption of
alcohol, sodium, and saturated fat (Whelton et al., 2002). Severe
hypertension occurs when the blood pressure climbs to 180 mm Hg
systolic/110 mm Hg diastolic or higher. Severely elevated blood
pressure can lead to stroke or organ damage and can be classiﬁed as
hypertensive crisis or emergency, when there are clear signs or
symptoms, or as severe asymptomatic hypertension, when there
are no such symptoms (Kessler and Joudeh, 2010). Overall, most
people with high blood pressure have no signs or symptoms, even
when their blood pressure reaches dangerously high levels. This is a
serious problem worldwide because patients who suffer from it,
often do not manifest any symptoms and therefore seek no medical
help. This is even more problematic in developing countries, where
people do not engage in routine medical examinations, and
asymptomatic conditions can go undetected.
Strauss et al. (2010)report ﬁgures of 49% hypertension under-
diagnosis for men in China, and 42% for women. In our sample
from Indonesia, about 60% of respondents are under-diagnosed,
again with larger percentages for men than for women.Witoelar
et al. (2012)argue that under-diagnosis is only weakly correlated
with SES and this is supported byStrauss et al. (2010)who ﬁnd that
SES attributes such as income and education do not affect hyper-
tension detection, but community characteristics matter. However,
they do not consider the role of individual time preferences and
their differential impact on healthy versus unhealthy people.
The purpose of our paper is to argue that, when it comes to
asymptomatic disease detection, SES and individual time
preference matter, but their effects are different for healthy versus
unhealthy people. Community characteristics matter for all, as they
proxy for healthcare access and lower costs of seeking healthcare,
but disease detection does not only depend on available resources
but also on the willingness of people to use those resources. The
choice of individuals to subject themselves to medical examina-
tions can be modeled as a discrete choice to go to the doctor or carry
on their daily productive activities. We argue that education and
time preferences might have different effects when it comes to this
choice. We hypothesize that a generally healthy person might not
seek medical care and his disease might go undetected, regardless
of how educated he is, whereas a person with a poor health status
might seek medical help in spite of a high time preference
parameter. Education however, being correlated with earning po-
tential, represents a measure of opportunity cost of being sick and
therefore we would expect people with poor general health status
to be more likely to seek medical care if they have more education.
We also hypothesize similarly different effects of education and
time preferences on disease management, once patients are
diagnosed.
Analyzing the different effects of education and time preference
parameters on health detection versus health management is
extremely important from a policy standpoint. Policies geared to-
wards improving health outcomes traditionally addressed
improving educational attainments or improving access to health
care. Better educating people and lowering the cost of healthcare is
by all means extremely important. However, when it comes to
disease detection and prevention, these traditional policies might
be inadequate and not able to cope with the realities. The well
documented facts regarding the high incidence of hypertension
under-diagnosis in developing countries seem to support this.
Using a sample of 4209 hypertensive adults surveyed in the
fourth wave of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS), weﬁnd
that the probability of suffering from hypertension but being un-
diagnosed is affected by both education and individual time pref-
erences. However, these effects are different when disegregating
the sample. Time preference does not matter for people with poor
health, while education is not a factor for people with good health.
Also other factors such as income and access to healthcare have
different effects for healthy and unhealthy people. Similar results
were found for disease management. We conclude that, for
asymptomatic disease detection, it is important that new policies
are designed and implemented. Proactive door to door campaigns
to check vital health statistics, or providing incentives for routine
medical examinations might address this issue by targeting overall
healthy people with undiagnosed asymptomatic conditions who
would otherwise not visit a medical center. Educational campaigns
that speciﬁcally address the beneﬁts of routine medical examina-
tions might also prove useful, but in the absence of further in-
centives it is unclear whether they could signiﬁcantly reduce the
number of those under-diagnosed.
2. Theoretical framework
We model the probability of being diagnosed when suffering
from an asymptomatic condition as being 1 if the individual is
undergoing a medical exam, or 0 otherwise. In practice, there are of
course exceptions to this rule. For instance individuals might self-
screen themselves for high blood pressure using personal moni-
toring devices and become aware of their condition without
visiting a doctor. On the other hand, hypertension can be unde-
tected during regular physical exams due to errors in measurement
or faulty machines. However, the probability of these events
occurring is very small overall and therefore, for the purpose of this
study, we simply assume it to be zero. Hence, the base theoretical
Y. Kim, V. Radoias / Social Science & Medicine 150 (2016) 15e2216
model that we will test is a discrete choice model of whether in-
dividuals choose to subject themselves to a physical exam. As is the
standard in the health literature, for instance when modeling
health demand functions, we assume this decision to depend on
individual social and economic well-being, community infrastruc-
ture and access to healthcare, and individual time and risk prefer-
ences. Formally, we can write this discrete choice probability
function as:
PðdiagnosedjsickÞij ¼ F
/C0
SESi; Cj; Ti; Ri
/C1
where the dependent variable represents the probability of indi-
vidual i living in community j undergoing a physical exam and
hence being diagnosed (given the patient is actually sick).SESi are
social-economic status variables,Cj are community level variables
that proxy for infrastructure and access to healthcare,Ti is the in-
dividual time preference parameter, andRi is the individual risk
preference parameter.
As is the case in the literature, we focus on Education as the
most important SES indicator for health outcomes. Where our pa-
per diverges from the existing literature is in realizing there is an
additional effect of education on health, which comes from op-
portunity costs associated with undergoing physical exams. We
claim these opportunity costs affect individuals differently,
depending on their general health status. Therefore, we argue that
education can actually have negative effects on health outcomes,
unlike in the existent literature that only documented the positive
effects of education. We do not claim that these negative effects
overcome the positive effects, and therefore we agree with the
larger body of literature that improvements in educational attain-
ments improve overall health outcomes. We only claim that for the
speciﬁc case of asymptomatic disease detection, improvements in
education might not be sufﬁcient to address the problem.
Our main hypothesis is that, while better educated people are
overall more aware of the importance of undergoing regular
medical exams, more education also means higher overall wages
and hence, higher opportunity costs of undergoing these medical
exams. For individuals suffering from asymptomatic conditions
that are in good general health status and thus their earning po-
tential is not affected, these negative effects from education can
completely counteract the positive effects. This can be especially
problematic in developing countries, where the overall levels of
education are low and poverty is high. If, on the other hand, people
are in poor general health status, this affects their earning potential
and the opportunity cost of not undergoing a physical is hence
directly correlated with education. For these individuals, the two
effects are reinforcing each other and education has the usually
assumed positive effect on health. According to this hypothesis, we
should observe signiﬁcantly smaller (possibly zero or even nega-
tive) effects of education for generally healthy people than for
unhealthy people. The magnitude of this difference should depend
on the overall levels of education and economic well-being, but we
expect a signiﬁcant difference to exist in developing countries such
as Indonesia.
To test this hypothesis, we estimate two discrete choice models
corresponding to the two distinct populations: individuals in good
general health status vs. individuals in poor general health status.
We expect toﬁnd signiﬁcantly different effects of education be-
tween these two groups: education should have a clear positive
effect for individuals in poor health status (and at the aggregate
level), and a smaller (possibly zero or negative) effect for in-
dividuals in good health status.
Based on similar theoretical aspects, we also expect to notice
group speciﬁc differences for the effects of the time preference
parameter. Unlike education, impatience generally works against
health in general, and this has been documented to be true at the
aggregate level. This negative effect should also be true forﬁner
dimensions of health such as undergoing regular medical exams
(which is of outmost importance for detecting asymptomatic con-
ditions). However, we argue that for people in poor health, impa-
tience has an additional canceling effect because poor health affects
present earning potential. We therefore expect a positive effect of
impatience on the probability of being under-diagnosed for in-
dividuals in good health (and also at the aggregate level), and a
smaller (possibly zero or negative) effect for individuals in poor
health.
To our knowledge, these different effects of education and time
preferences stemming from differences in opportunity costs be-
tween groups have not been studied elsewhere and we believe they
are important to be understood. Formally, the reduced form
equations that we will further describe in the methodology section
are:
PðunderdiagnosedjgoodGHSÞij ¼ bgoodGHSEDUi þ ggoodGHSTi
þ dgoodGHSXij þ εij
PðunderdiagnosedjpoorGHSÞij ¼ bpoorGHSEDUi þ gpoorGHSTi
þ dpoorGHSXij þ εij
where the dependent variables take the value 1 for people suffering
from hypertension but not being diagnosed by a doctor (condi-
tioning on belonging to one of the two groups),EDUi represents the
education variable,Ti the time preference parameter,Xij is a vector
of other individual and community variables that will be detailed in
the next section, andεij is the error term representing unobserv-
ables uncorrelated with the other regressors.
3. Data and methodology
We use data from the fourth wave of the Indonesian Family Life
Survey (IFLS), which was ﬁelded between November 2007 and
April 2008 by the RAND corporation in collaboration with the
Center for Population and Policy Studies of the University of Gadjah
Mada and Survey METER. The IFLS is a longitudinal survey which
tracks down a sample representing over 80% of the Indonesian
population. It surveys individual respondents and their immediate
family members. The IFLS is a publicly available data set and has
received IRB approval both at RAND and in Indonesia. A variety of
socio-economic indicators are collected such as education, health,
income, community level infrastructure, etc. There are currently
four waves of the IFLS that have beenﬁelded in 1993, 1997, 2000,
and 2007. The latest wave is of particular interest to us, as it con-
tains a module on elicited risk and time preference parameters.
Risk and time preferences were elicited by subjecting respondents
to a series of questions based on hypothetical lotteries. Speciﬁcally,
to elicit risk preferences, the questions were formulated as:
“Suppose you are given two options of receiving income. In the
ﬁrst option you are guaranteed X rupiah per month. In the second
option you are guaranteed Y or Z rupiah, each with equal chance.
Which option would you choose?”
Respondents were faced with a sequence of such questions,
where the riskiness of the next uncertain payoff depended on the
respondent's previous choice. If he picked the sure amount, he
would then be offered a less risky payoff on the next question. If he
picked the uncertain payoff, he would then be offered a higher risk
payoff on the next question. At the end of this sequence, each
respondent could be classi ﬁed according to his/her individual
attitude towards risk. Eliciting time preferences was done in a
Y. Kim, V. Radoias / Social Science & Medicine 150 (2016) 15e22 17
similar fashion. Each respondent was asked a series of questions
formulated as:
“Suppose you have won a prize. How will you choose to be
paid?”
Respondents were then given the option between an amount to
be paid today and a larger nominal amount to be paid at a later date.
In order to elicit time preferences, the future payoffs were again
changed in a sequence of questions, depending on respondents'
previous choices. If they chose to be paid today, the future payoff on
the next question would be higher; if they chose to be paid later, the
future payoff on the next question would be smaller. This series of
adjustments allow us to order respondents according to their in-
dividual time preferences.
There is some dispute in the literature regarding survey based
methodologies versus experimental methodologies. Experiments
have the advantage of ensuring incentive compatibility by offering
real money payoffs, but they are often cost prohibitive and cannot
be administered on a large scale. Surveys can easily achieve this
large scale and elicit parameters from nationally-representative
samples, but hypothetical lotteries might not be behaviorally
valid (Binswanger, 1980; Holt and Laury, 2002). However, some
recent evidence showed that survey-elicited risk and time prefer-
ence parameters are consistent with experimentally derived pa-
rameters, and parameters derived using hypothetical lotteries were
shown to be consistent with those based on real money lotteries
(Dohmen et al., 2011; Hamoudi, 2006). An additional argument
against elicited time and risk preferences is that monetary based
time preferences might not translate very well into time prefer-
ences related to health outcomes. A paper byChapman and Coups
(1999) showed however, that monetary based time preferences are
more likely to affect preventative health behavior than health
based time preferences. There is no consensus in the literature
regarding measuring time preferences (Chabris et al., 2007), but the
IFLS method is the most widely-used.
Our sample consists of 4209 hypertensive adults (over 45 years
of age in 2007), 1793 men and 2416 women. Some of these in-
dividuals were documented hypertensive patients, while others
were not aware that they suffered from it at the time of the survey.
As part of the survey, trained nurses measured respondents' blood
pressure three different times. Theﬁrst measurement was dropped
because many people get nervous atﬁrst which can cause false high
measurements. We then used the average of the other two mea-
surements to construct the hypertension variable. Following WHO
standards, a person is considered hypertensive if his systolic is
greater than 140 or his diastolic is greater than 90. IFLS also asked
respondents if they had ever been diagnosed with hypertension
before. Therefore, the under-diagnosed respondents were those
who were found to be hypertensive during IFLS survey measure-
ments, but had not been previously diagnosed by doctors.Table 1
presents simple summary statistics of hypertension under-
diagnosis in the IFLS sample:
The table presents a very serious issue that is prevalent in
developing countries with more than half of the population being
under-diagnosed. In the IFLS sample, 67% of the men and 54% of
the women who were found hypertensive during theﬁelding of
the survey had not been previously diagnosed by doctors.
Traditional health policy was formulated around improving access
to healthcare, improving educational attainments, economic
development, etc. However, in spite of many programs that were
designed and implemented, under-diagnosis remains a prob-
lematic issue.
We argue that, while socio-economic status matters generally in
a health context, for disease detection and prevention it might not
be a very good predictor, and especially so in developing countries
and for asymptomatic conditions such as hypertension. The role of
traditional education in particular might have little to do with
people deciding to routinely visit a doctor in the absence of
symptoms. A large portion of hypertensive people are in good
general health, with no obvious health concerns or symptoms. If
this proves to be so, then different policies need to be implemented
to reach these individuals. Educational programs need to specif-
ically target the importance of routine medical exams, and even
those might be insufﬁcient if opportunity costs and time prefer-
ences are high.
To test this hypothesis, we estimate the effects of SES and in-
dividual risk and time preference parameters on the probability of
being hypertensive, but under-diagnosed. Our dependent variable
is a dummy equal to one for those respondents who were found to
be hypertensive during the IFLS screenings, but were not previ-
ously diagnosed by a doctor. We are especially interested in the
differential effects that SES and the time and risk preferences
might have on people, conditional on their general health status.
To this end, we estimate these effects for two separate subsamples
of individuals: those in good general health and those in poor
general health. Respondents were asked to evaluate their general
health status (GHS) on a scale from 1 to 4. Depending on the an-
swers provided, we split the sample in two groups: a healthy
group containing respondents who characterized their general
health status as being either “very healthy ” or “somewhat
healthy”, and an unhealthy group containing respondents who
claimed they were either”unhealthy” or “somewhat unhealthy”.
Explanatory variables include respondents' education (measured
in years of formal education), respondents' age and age squared
(to allow for possible non-linear effects), respondents' individual
risk and time preferences, the distance from the closest health
center (to proxy for the ease of access to medical care), household
per capita expenditures (PCE), and a sex dummy. Per capita ex-
penditures is used here as a proxy for household income. It has
been shown inBound and Krueger (1991)that there are system-
atic measurement errors in household income, and PCE has been
since used as a proxy for income in many papers, as it is less prone
to such measurement errors. These are all commonly used cova-
riates for health outcomes that are used to proxy for education,
economic well-being, and community infrastructure and access to
healthcare. See, for instance, Grossman (2006) for a literature
review that documents the role of education andStrauss et al.
(2010) that document the role of community access to health-
care. We have to acknowledge the fact that both education and
time preferences could be endogenous. Becker and Mulligan
(1997) in particular, argued for the endogenous determination
of time preferences. Deﬁnitive estimates for the partial effects of
both education and time preferences are extremely hard to
identify, and to our knowledge no attempt has been made so far in
the literature. We also tested for multicollinearity following
Belsley et al. (2005)and found no cause for concern. For the time
and risk preference parameters, we followNg (2013) and group
respondents in four distinct groups from the most patient to the
most impatient, respectively from the least risk averse to the most
risk averse. For all our estimations, we use a probit model and
report the marginal effects of the explanatory variables.

4. Disease detection results
Table 2 contains the probit regression results for the de-
terminants of hypertension under-diagnosis. The three separate
columns represent, in order, the results for the entire sample, the
results for the subsample consisting of respondents in good general
health, and the results for the subsample consisting of respondents
in poor general health.
We are able to con ﬁrm previous studies that showed the
importance, at the aggregate level, of both SES and community
level characteristics for disease diagnosis. The level of education,
household economic resources, and the access to health care all
matter at the aggregate level. We also conﬁrm that individual time
preferences are important for disease detection in the same way
that they are important for overall health measures, and that ac-
counting for individual time and risk preferences lowers the
magnitude of the education coefﬁcient. In a model that does not
include time and risk preferences, the impact of an additional year
of schooling was estimated to reduce the probability of being
under-diagnosed by 0.00354, which is higher than the 0.00333
effect reported inTable 2. This is in line withVan Der Pol (2011)
who reports a similar effect for overall health. This seems to sup-
port the idea that at least some of the previously documented ef-
fects of education were in fact confounded time preference effects,
since time preferences affect the education decision of people. We
do notﬁnd risk preferences to matter for disease detection, but we
cannot argue against their importance for overall health. In spite of
all the consistent results, we claim however, that the aggregate
image does not tell the whole story on disease detection and
prevalence of under-diagnosis, and we prove this by disaggregating
the sample into generally healthy versus unhealthy respondents.
What we ﬁnd are different effects for healthy and for unhealthy
people, which are consistent with simple economic intuition.
For individuals in good health, the education level does not
matter at all, while for respondents in poor health, the time pref-
erence parameter and distance to health center do not matter. This
is somehow intuitive. For people in good overall health, the deci-
sion to routinely check their health status and potentially discover
asymptomatic conditions is simply a time management decision.
How educated they are bares no weight, and the previously docu-
mented effects from education are simply time preference effects
for these individuals in good health. They might postpone (some-
times indeﬁnitely) their visit to a health post, depending on both
their individual time preference and also on how close these health
posts are, which speaks to ease of access and smaller time
expenditures.
On the other hand, people who are in poor overall health will
feel the need to go see a doctor, regardless of their patience or
ease of access. Their poor health and the hope of ﬁnding a
cure to their problems will force them to go to a health center.
During these visits the medical staff will surely discover
asymptomatic conditions such as hypertension. Blood pressure
measurements are one of theﬁrst vital checks that every patient
is subjected to once they visit a medical center. Education mat-
ters for these people, as more educated persons generally have
higher opportunity costs of feeling sick and hence value their
health higher, which pushes them harder to look for a cure in a
doctor's ofﬁce.
These different results make us conjecture that the role of ed-
ucation on health detection and health in general might be often
misinterpreted. Many seem to believe that education affects health
in the sense that more educated people live better and healthier
lives because their higher education teaches them how to live
better and healthier lives. Our results seem to suggest that this is
not true. If this was true, we would surelyﬁnd education effects for
the healthy people as well. In fact, what seems to be the case is that
more educated people, who generally earn higher wages and are
therefore hurt more when they get sick and cannot fully perform
their productive activities, respond better toﬁnding and managing
their problems, but only when these problems manifest themselves
in a clear, health impairing symptom.
Note that economic resources still play important roles for
everybody. People with better economic endowments are more
likely to be diagnosed, but the magnitude of this effect is smaller for
people in poor health. This further strengthens the idea that a poor
general health status incentivizes individuals to
ﬁnd the resources
necessary for medical visits, or have these medical visits in spite of
the lack of economic resources. These results paint a profoundly sad
picture that the aging population in developing countries is faced
with. Because of constant economic struggles, and the huge pres-
sure to use their time working, in order to have a chance at getting
diagnosed for asymptomatic chronic conditions, individualsﬁrst
need to become generally unhealthy to the point where the sheer
need to get help will push them to a medical facility. Education, at
least traditional education that we measure in years of schooling,
does not seem to be important as long as people feel healthy. Even
more so, under-diagnosis seems to be an especially problematic
issue for men, who arguably are heads of household and feel even a
higher pressure to worryﬁrst about time spent on economically
rewarding activities rather than taking time off to routinely check
their health status. Even for people in poor health, men are about
11% more likely to ignore their health and remain under-diagnosed,
and that is after accounting for SES, access to healthcare, and time
preferences.

5. Disease management
The role of education and time preferences does not stop at
detecting diseases. Another important component of the individual
health is disease management.Goldman and Smith (2002)docu-
mented links between education and disease management, while
Axon et al. (2009)showed the importance of time preferences in
the same context of disease management. To our knowledge
however, there is no study that links both of these two variables
with health management and distinguishing between generally
healthy and less healthy individuals. Just as with disease detection,
education and time preferences might have differential impacts.
For instance, people who feel good might occasionally skip on their
medication or routine examinations if pressed by other mundane
activities. On the other hand, people who do not feel very good
might pay more attention to their lifestyles and follow through
with their treatment. An additional issue that separates our paper
from previous research is that we focus on asymptomatic diseases
which might yield different results than for diseases such as dia-
betes, where the symptoms can be severe enough to force people
into properly managing their disease.
There are many parts to disease management: routine follow up
medical exams and tests, medication protocols, changing diets and
lifestyles, etc. In the case of hypertension, one of the most impor-
tant and at the same time one of the easiest things to do is
frequently monitoring your blood pressure. The IFLS collects in-
formation on the timing of the most recent blood pressure mea-
surements of respondents. We construct a dummy variable that is
equal to 1 if respondents checked their blood pressure at least once
in the month preceding the interview. Disease management does
not apply to individuals who are not aware of having any disease, so
we restrict our sample to those respondents who were previously
diagnosed with hypertension. Summary statistics are presented in
Table 3:
Out of 1696 previously diagnosed respondents, only 406
(23.94%) routinely monitored their blood pressure during the
month preceding the IFLS interview. This picture is even more
troublesome than the under-diagnosis picture was. It shows that
even after being diagnosed with hypertension, more than 75% of
the patients do not engage in the most simple and least expensive
activity that is required for properly managing their conditione
frequently monitoring their blood pressure. Theﬁgures are, once
again, slightly less favorable for men, although the disparity be-
tween sexes is not as pronounced as in the case of under-diagnosis.
We estimate probit models and report the marginal effects of
the same set of explanatory variables on this disease management
proxy. Table 4 presents the results, with theﬁrst column repre-
senting the whole sample, the second column the respondents in
good general health, and the third column the respondents in poor
general health.
As predicted, we do observe different effects, both in magnitude
and signiﬁcance for generally healthy and generally unhealthy re-
spondents. The level of education matters for all respondents, but
with different magnitudes. More speciﬁcally, for individuals in
poorer general health, education has a larger impact than for in-
dividuals in good health who possess no obvious impairing
symptoms. This strengthens the idea that education affects health
through two distinct channels. First, education gives people a better
understanding of what it means to live a healthy lifestyle and of the
importance of properly managing one's disease, regardless of
symptoms. This channel did not seem to be important for disease
detection, but it is important for disease management. Individuals
with less education might be more often tempted to skip a step in
their recovery if they feel like their condition is overall good, while
more educated individuals know better that some diseases are
asymptomatic and they should follow through with their recovery
regimen despite an overall good health status. The second channel
through which education affects health, that seems to be important
for both health detection and for health management, but that only
works for individuals with more severe symptoms that impairs
their day to day activities, is through the opportunity costs of being
sick. Individuals with higher education have a higher opportunity
cost of being sick and are therefore incentivized further to properly
address their health and follow their recovery protocols.
In terms of individual time preferences, they only matter for the
aggregate sample and for the respondents in good health. Re-
spondents in poor health check their blood pressure often,
regardless of their time preference. Their poor health pushes them
to adopt good, healthy habits. Individuals in good health however,
are affected by their time preference. The more impatient re-
spondents check their blood pressure less often. This implies once
again how important it is to implement programs that actively
push everybody to routine blood pressure testing, designed to both
detect and monitor the detected disease.
Household economic resources matter for those in good health,
perhaps because wealthier people can afford to buy their own
blood pressure measurement kits. There do not seem to be any
signi
ﬁcant effects for disease management caused by risk prefer-
ences, access to healthcare, or sex. However, we cannot reject
possible effects of these factors for other measures of health
management. As mentioned before, measuring blood pressure is
only one of the many components that enter health management.
Other components that enter disease prevention and recovery
protocols such as following through with medication, engaging in
physical exercise, maintaining a proper diet, or eliminating vice-
goods consumption could be affected by risk preferences as well.
Most of the lifestyle choices that contribute to a bad management
of hypertension are providing some level of utility to individuals
and are therefore attractive, but risky from a health perspective.
Therefore, individuals with different tolerances to risk might
respond differently to these types of incentives. The present paper
cannot tackle these questions unfortunately due to data limitations,
but we believe more research efforts should be made in this
direction.
6. Policy considerations
Health has been a continuous focus of policy makers in devel-
oping countries where resources are scarce. It is hence important to
understand precisely the channels and mechanisms that improve
health, in order for resources to be allocated efﬁciently. Many
developing countries allocate too much of their health budgets to

public hospitals that only address the needs of the urban elites,
while impoverished villagers suffer or die from conditions that
could be easily treated or prevented (Filmer et al., 2000).
It has been generally accepted in the health economics literature
that, in order to improve health outcomes, efforts have to be made
towards increasing the availability and quality of health services,
but also towards providing the population with the right incentives
to use these resources and stimulating the demand for health ser-
vices. In that sense, public spending alone will not address the
whole problem. Issues regarding the low utilization and the inef-
fectiveness of health services such as community health workers
were documented by Sauerborn et al. (1989)and Berman et al.
(1987). However, the low utilization of publicly provided commu-
nity services was mainly attributed to quality considerations and
bypassing (seeAkin et al., 1995or Akin and Hutchinson, 1999).
At the same time, some economists realized that the smaller the
elasticity of demand for health services, the smaller the impact of
public spending, thus advocating for demand-side mechanisms to
improve the demand for services such as routine examinations
(Filmer et al., 2000). This is both good news and bad news for
addressing the hypertension under-diagnosis problem. The good
news comes from the fact that, due to the asymptomatic nature of
hypertension, patients suffering from it are likely to be extremely
sensitive to price and availability of health services, and therefore
public spending will have a larger impact. Papers likeCretin et al.
(1990) or Gertler and Molyneaux (1996)showed that demand for
health is less elastic for more serious conditions and symptoms. On
the other hand however, due to the high elasticity, this population
will not engage is preventative behaviors absent proper incentives
to compensate for the opportunity cost of seeking these services.
Our results strengthen this idea, and provide evidence that op-
portunity costs play important roles in both the early detection and
the management of hypertension.
Indonesia has been going through a series of health reforms over
the past few decades that emphasized decentralization, health
promotion and prevention, quality and affordability of healthcare,
social mobilization and community empowerment, etc.Daly and
Fane (2002) present a comprehensive review of the economic
programs implemented in Indonesia since the 1990s andﬁnd that
healthcare was the most accurately targeted area. In spite of this
however, hypertension under-diagnosis remains unusually high,
which suggests that the current strategies are not efﬁcient in this
regard. More recent studies have been showing evidence that in-
centives that speciﬁcally target commitment to healthy behaviors
and routine medical screenings are more effective than generic
programs targeting improvements in overall SES (Thornton, 2008;
Banerjee et al., 2010 ). Our present study brings yet another
argument that better designed programs need to be implemented
to speciﬁcally target the asymptomatic individuals that have a high
elasticity of demand for health services. These programs, if imple-
mented efﬁciently, should prove having a large impact. High elas-
ticity of demand individuals will respond to incentives better than
low elasticity individuals, and hypertension is generally cheap and
easy to manage if detected in its early stages. Since developing
countries like Indonesia have been going through a health transi-
tion from infectious diseases to chronic diseases during the past
decades, it is likely that local governments are still too much
focused on addressing infectious diseases and early mortality at the
expense of detecting and preventing chronic diseases. While basic
investments in community infrastructure and economic well being
are the main avenues of combating infectious diseases, they prove
inadequate to address one of the most important preventable
contributors to disease and death in the modern world. We believe
policymakers should address this growing problem by targeting
the asymptomatic individuals through incentives that encourage
routine physical examinations. These could include, but not limited
to, focused educational programs, conditional cash transfers, or
government sponsored medical home visits to screen for
hypertension.
At the same time, while the direction of the effects shown by our
results paints a clear picture of why current policies failed in
addressing the problem, we have to acknowledge the limitation of
our estimation strategy in regards to the magnitudes of these ef-
fects. We encourage future research to try to address the possible
endogeneity of education and time preferences simultaneously,
and possibly consider other omitted variables that could potentially
be correlated with our regressors and hence bias their magnitudes.
7. Conclusions
This paper presents proof that education and individual time
preferences clearly affect health through two of its most important
components: health detection, and disease management. The focus
is on asymptomatic chronic conditions that are pervasive in both
developed and under-developed economies. In particular, we study
the effects of education and individual time preferences on hy-
pertension under-diagnosis and hypertension management in
Indonesia. Weﬁnd these effects to be very different, in both mag-
nitudes and signiﬁcance, for generally healthy people than they are
for generally unhealthy people. Since hypertension is asymptom-
atic and does not cause many impairing symptoms in its early
stages, many patients carry it unknowingly for years. Especially in
developing countries, where people are faced with severe eco-
nomic challenges, taking time to schedule a routine medical

examination that could potentially identify the disease is often the
last thing that a person thinks of. It is extremely discouraging that
many times, in such environments, the only chance that people
have to being diagnosed is toﬁrst succumb to other (symptomatic)
maladies that will somehow impair their health and push them
through the doors of a medical center.
We ﬁnd that education and other SES, as well as individual time
preferences matter for disease detection and management, but only
in the aggregate sample. For respondents in good health, education
is not signiﬁcant for disease detection, while for respondents in bad
health, time preference is not signiﬁcant for both disease detection
and disease management. For disease detection, the problem is
even more severe for men who are heads of households and value
their productive time even higher. We also point at two distinct
channels through which education affects healthe a direct channel
where education increases respondents' awareness about health,
and an indirect channel where education affects respondents' at-
titudes towards health only through earnings effects.
All our results point to the real cause of the severe under-
diagnosis problem that persists in developing countries such as
Indonesia. While economic resources and SES matter in general,
they do not address the root of the problem. Traditional programs
and policies targeting education and general economic help can
improve the overall outcome, but will fall short for a signiﬁcant
portion of the population. Targeted educational programs that
stress the importance of routine examinations, conditional eco-
nomic incentives that pay speciﬁcally for routine testing, and active
early detection programs that test people in the comfort of their
own homes should prove more effective in reaching a larger pop-
ulation and reducing the overall level of under-diagnosis, which
will undoubtedly lead to improving the overall health of the pop-
ulation in the long run.

  "claim.hypotheses": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The extracted hypotheses focus on demographic, workplace satisfaction, and organizational/relational factors influencing turnover intention, which partially overlaps with the reference hypothesis about job satisfaction reducing turnover intention. However, the core hypothesis about job satisfaction is not directly captured."

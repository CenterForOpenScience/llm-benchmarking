  "interpretation_summary": "The replication study successfully executed a logistic regression analysis to assess the impact of job satisfaction on turnover intention among U.S. federal employees. The glm.cluster function was replaced with a standard glm function, and clustered standard errors were calculated manually. The replication results supported the hypothesis with a similar negative coefficient for job satisfaction, consistent with the original study.",

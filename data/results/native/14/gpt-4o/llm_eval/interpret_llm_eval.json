  "interpretation_summary": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The summary captures the core meaning of the replication study, including the use of logistic regression and the support for the hypothesis. However, it includes additional details about the glm.cluster function that are not present in the reference document."
  },
  "execute_status": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The execution status is 'Success', which matches the reference document's indication that the claim was replicated successfully."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The method alignment is mostly similar, as it mentions the use of logistic regression and a minor deviation in calculating clustered standard errors. The reference document states no deviations, but the core method alignment is preserved."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].issue_description": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The issue description about the glm.cluster function is not mentioned in the reference document, which states no deviations. This is a significant difference."
  },
  "fidelity_assessment.deviations[0].impact": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The impact is described as low, which is not mentioned in the reference document. The reference states no deviations, indicating a discrepancy."
  },
  "results_comparison.hypothesis_tested": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The hypothesis tested is an exact match with the reference document, which states that job satisfaction negatively influences turnover intention."
  },
  "results_comparison.original_results": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The original results are mostly similar, capturing the essence of job satisfaction and age affecting turnover intention. However, the numerical details differ slightly from the reference."
  },
  "results_comparison.replication_results": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The replication results match the reference document, with the same coefficient and p-value for job satisfaction."
  },
  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The overall answer is an exact match, confirming that the replication results satisfy the preregistered comparison criteria."
  },
  "replication_report": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The replication report is mostly similar, capturing the core findings of job satisfaction and age negatively associated with turnover intention. However, it lacks specific numerical details present in the reference."
  },
  "failure_handling[0].failure_type": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The failure type mentioned is not present in the reference document, which states no deviations or failures."
  },
  "failure_handling[0].suggestions": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The suggestions for handling failures are not relevant to the reference document, which indicates no failures."
  },
  "notes": {
    "score": 1,
    "explanation": "The notes mention manual calculation of clustered standard errors, which is not addressed in the reference document. This indicates a discrepancy."

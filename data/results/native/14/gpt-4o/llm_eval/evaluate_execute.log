2026-01-12 08:52:56,041 - replication - INFO - ***Agent input: Your goal is to successfully execute the replication study inside a Docker container.
You are operating in a DEBUG LOOP. You must assess the result of every action. 

RUN POLICY (EXECUTE)
- Do NOT translate code to Python.
- If the code is incompatible with the data, you should rewrite the code to make it compatible using the edit_file tool.
- Execute the original-language entrypoint from replication_info.json.
- If it fails, debug in the same language or adjust dependencies.

File operations policy:
 - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
 - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
 - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.

If an action fails (e.g., Docker build error, Missing Dependency, Code crash), you MUST:
1. Analyze the error message in the Observation.
2. Use `write_file` to FIX the issue (e.g., rewrite `replication_info.json` to add packages, or rewrite the code files). Remember that write_file will overwrite any existing content in the provided file_path if existing. When you use the tool, the provided path file_path to the tool MUST be the study path given to you. But to access other files within the file_content argument, you MUST use the container's directories "app/data". 
3. RETRY the failed step.

**Phases of Execution:**

PHASE 1: BUILD ENVIRONMENT
1. `orchestrator_generate_dockerfile`: Creates _runtime/Dockerfile from replication_info.json.

The execution of the replication study was completed successfully after addressing several issues related to package dependencies and function availability. The `glm.cluster` function was replaced with a standard `glm` function, and clustered standard errors were calculated manually. The logistic regression analysis was executed on the dataset to assess the impact of job satisfaction on turnover intention among U.S. federal employees. The results showed significant effects for key variables such as JobSat, Over40, and NonMinority. The execution environment included R with data.table, sandwich, multiwayvcov, miceadds, and lmtest packages.

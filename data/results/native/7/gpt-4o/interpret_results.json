  "interpretation_summary": "The replication aimed to test the hypothesis that average working hours per worker in a state are positively associated with carbon emissions, using a similar dataset and methodology as the original study. However, the execution failed due to a data-related issue with the `State` variable, which had fewer than two levels, preventing the contrasts needed for the analysis. Despite high fidelity in data sourcing and methodological alignment, the replication could not be completed successfully.",

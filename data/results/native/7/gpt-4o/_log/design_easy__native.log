    First, determine whether the provided data can be used for replicating the provided focal claim. 
    - Ensure that all necessary variables are available.
    - Ensure that the data qualify for replication criteria. Replication data achieves its purpose by being different data collected under similar/identical conditions, thus testing if the phenomenon is robust across independent instances.
    
    If you find issues with the provided data, follow-up with a human supervisor to ask for a different data source until appropriate data is given.
    
    Once you have determined the provided data are good for replication, explore the code to help fill out fields related to the codebase. This code will operate directly on the data files given to you.
    Find potential issues with the provided code such as a data file path that is different from the data files you have looked at.
    - If the code reads any data file, the file path must be in this directory "/app/data".
    - If the code dumps content or produce additional content, the file must also be in this directory "/app/data".
    
    RUN POLICY (DESIGN)
- Do NOT translate code to Python.
- Run the original language code (R/.do/etc.).
- If the code is incompatible with the data, you should rewrite the code to make it compatible using the edit_file tool.
- Otherwise only make minimal fixes needed to run (paths to /app/data, deps, small execution bugs etc.).
- Identify the correct entrypoint and execution order.

    If your code reads in any data file, ASSUME that the data will be in this directory: "/app/data".
    If you code produce any addtional files, the code must save the files in this directory: "/app/data".

    File operations policy:
    - To modify existing files: ALWAYS call read_file first, then use edit_file for targeted changes.
    - write_file is for creating new files. It will refuse to overwrite unless overwrite=True.
    - Only use write_file(overwrite=True) when you intend to replace the entire file contents.
    
    After all issues have been resolved, finish by complete by filling out the required JSON with all the updated/final information to prepare for replication execution.

State-level carbon emissions and average working hours have a strong, positive relationship, which holds across a variety of model estimation techniques and net of various political, economic, and demographic drivers of emissions. Specifically, they find that, over time, a 1 percent increase in average working hours per worker is associated with a 0.668 percent increase in emissions, holding all else constant

[HYPOTHESIS]
Average working hours per worker in a state will be positively associated with carbon emissions.

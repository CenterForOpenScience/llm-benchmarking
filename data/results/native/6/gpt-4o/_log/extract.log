The document was too long to read directly, so here is a detailed summary of all sections:

**Title:** Traditional, Modern, and Post-Secular Perspectives on Science and Religion in the United States

**Authors:** Timothy L. O’Brien and Shiri Noy

**Source:** American Sociological Review (2015)

**Key Methodologies:**
- Utilized General Social Survey (GSS) data to analyze perspectives on science and religion in the United States.
- Employed Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to categorize individuals based on their knowledge, attitudes about science, religiosity, and preferences for religious interpretations.
- Introduced regression models to assess the relationship between science-religion perspectives and political views on contentious issues.

**Specific Metrics:**
- Identified three perspectives:
  - Traditional perspective: 43% (Preference for religion vs. science).
  - Modern perspective: 36% (Preference for science vs. religion).
  - Post-secular perspective: 21% (Favorable views towards both science and religion, but prioritizes religion on issues like creation vs. evolution).
  
**Results:**
- Latent class analysis indicated that most individuals lean towards either modern or traditional perspectives on the interaction between science and religion.
- The post-secular group, while recognizing both domains, largely bases their views on religious frameworks, especially on issues where science and religion conflict.
- Findings revealed that religiously inclined individuals may selectively reject certain scientific explanations without entirely dismissing science, indicating a nuanced coexistence of science and religion in their worldviews.

**Conclusions:**
- The findings challenge the notion that science and religion are inherently in conflict, suggesting instead that many individuals navigate a complex landscape where both can coexist, albeit with hierarchical preferences.
- Perspectives on science and religion extend beyond simple denominational divides, indicating deeper cultural and epistemological dimensions that shape individual beliefs and political attitudes, particularly on divisive issues like abortion and stem cell research.
- The study underscores the necessity of a more differentiated approach to understanding how individuals synthesize scientific and religious knowledge rather than treating them as polar opposites. 

**Keywords:** Science, Religion, Political Culture, Secularization, Cultural Conflict.

The document discusses the perspectives of individuals in the United States regarding science and religion, highlighting how these views have evolved over the past four decades. Key points include:

1. **Stability of Religious Participation**: While Europe has experienced a decline in religious participation, the U.S. has shown stability, contrary to secularization theories. Many Americans continue to support both science and religion, suggesting a lack of perceived conflict between them.

2. **Post-Secular Society Theories**: Theories suggest that individuals often blend scientific and religious views to form a comprehensive understanding of the world, functioning within a post-secular perspective. This perspective acknowledges the coexistence of multiple belief systems, rejecting the primacy of either science or religion.

3. **Four Perspectives on Science and Religion**: The text outlines four ideal types based on perspectives towards science and religion:
   - **Modern**: Favoring science over religion.
   - **Traditional**: Favoring religion over science.
   - **Post-Secular**: Favoring both science and religion.
   - **Postmodern**: Rejecting both as valid sources of understanding.

4. **Social Bases of Perspectives**: The document highlights several sociodemographic factors influencing perspectives on science and religion:
   - **Religious Tradition**: Individuals attending services regularly tend to favor religious explanations. Conservative Protestant traditions are linked to less acceptance of mainstream scientific views.
   - **Gender**: Women generally exhibit less favorable views towards science and more favorable views towards religion compared to men.
   - **Race and Ethnicity**: Non-white populations tend to have more favorable views towards religion and less favorable views towards science.
   - **Social Class**: Higher education and socioeconomic status are correlated with more favorable views of science and less favorable views of religion.

5. **Political Conflicts**: Perspectives on science and religion can influence political attitudes, particularly on issues like abortion and stem cell research, where science is often associated with liberal politics and religion with conservatism.

6. **Data and Methodology**: 
   - The analysis uses data from the General Social Survey (GSS) across the 2006, 2008, and 2010 waves, with a total sample of 2,901 respondents. 
   - Attitudes towards science were measured through questions reflecting public appreciation for science, while knowledge was assessed through 14 quiz-style items.

7. **Specific Data Points**: 
   - The sample mean for each category of religious and scientific perspectives is represented, with detailed tables indicating responses to key knowledge questions, showcasing the correct answers among different belief groups.

8. **Conclusion**: The framework suggests that social perspectives toward science and religion vary independently and that this variation can be understood through social bases like demographics, religious affiliation, gender, and social class. 

Overall, the research indicates that individuals navigate complex relationships between science and religion shaped by numerous factors, revealing a landscape of beliefs that is more nuanced than a simple alignment with either science or religion.

The text discusses an analysis aimed at understanding perspectives on science and religion, using data from the General Social Survey (GSS) from 2006, 2008, and 2010. The analysis employs latent class analysis (LCA) and multinomial logistic regression to identify distinct groups based on responses related to scientific understanding and religious beliefs. Key findings include:

### Key Methodologies:
1. **Survey Questions and Metrics**:
   - The document presents survey items related to scientific concepts (e.g., waves, evolution, the universe) with metrics for means, standard deviations, and identified latent classes.
   - Specific metrics include means (M), standard deviations (SD), and total sample sizes (N).

2. **Measurement of Variables**:
   - **Science Understanding**: Analyzed using binary and ordinal scales (e.g. 0-1 for specific beliefs).
   - **Science Attitudes**: Measured using a Likert scale (1 to 4) for beliefs about the benefits of science and government funding for research.
   - **Religion Indicators**: Questions regarding the Bible's nature and religious affiliation, measured on nominal and ordinal scales.

3. **Sociodemographic Variables**:
   - Included religious affiliation, attendance, race, age, education, and income. They are analyzed as either binary or ordinal categories.

4. **Political Attitudes**: Attitudes towards issues like abortion, government-funded research on stem cells, and support for GM foods were measured using binary or ordinal variables.

5. **Analytic Techniques**:
   - **Latent Class Analysis (LCA)**: Determined the number of underlying class structures in the data based on response patterns.
   - **Regression Analysis**: Multinomial logistic regression for sociodemographic characteristics and binary/ordinal logistic regression for political attitudes.

### Results:
- **LCA Findings**: The analysis identified three classes that best fit the data according to model fit statistics (e.g., LMR and BIC).
- **Sociodemographic Patterns**: Different classes displayed varying characteristics based on religious beliefs, education, and political views, suggesting significant correlations.
- **Statistical Data Points**:
   - A high percentage (e.g., .878) interpreted the message about inheriting illnesses, while .808 referred to the continents’ movements.
- **Distinct Group Characteristics**:
   - Traditional respondents had a higher belief in religious texts, while modern respondents showed a stronger acceptance of scientific explanations.

### Conclusions:
The analysis reveals significant cultural distinctions in American perspectives on science and religion, highlighting how these views are influenced by sociodemographic factors. The findings indicate that public attitudes towards scientific knowledge and religious belief systems are complex and intertwined, impacting political and social opinions. Future research could further explore the implications of these relationships in broader societal contexts.

The analysis conducted in the paper focuses on the relationship between perspectives on science and religion as identified through Latent Class Analysis (LCA). The key methodologies and findings from this research include:

1. **Model Selection**: The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Lo-Mendell-Rubin (LMR) likelihood-ratio test were examined for selecting the number of latent classes. The six-class model exhibited the lowest BIC, but due to differing recommendations for categorical outcomes, the analysis favored a three-class model based on substantive and theoretical considerations.

2. **Class Descriptions**: 
   - **Traditional Perspective**: This group comprises 43% of respondents and tends to hold lower science literacy and less favorable attitudes towards science, e.g., 47% correctly recognized radioactivity occurs naturally vs. 92% of the modern group.
   - **Modern Perspective**: Representing 36% of the sample, individuals in this class are knowledge-focused, optimistic about science, and least religious (only 3% believe the Bible is literally the word of God). They overwhelmingly accept scientific views like the big bang (p < .05).
   - **Post-Secular Perspective**: Held by 21% of respondents, this group has favorable attitudes towards science but also shows significant religious beliefs (48% regard the Bible as literal). Despite high science literacy, responses to evolution questions indicate some conflict with scientific accounts.

3. **Sociodemographic Findings**: The analysis displayed significant demographic differences across classes, where women, African Americans, Latinos, and those in lower social classes predominantly identify with the traditional perspective. Post-secular individuals are more likely to be older, politically conservative, and from the South.

4. **Statistical Analysis**: A multinomial logistic regression was employed to understand how various sociodemographic factors influenced the likelihood of belonging to a particular class. Key findings include:
   - Conservative Protestants are more likely to hold post-secular views compared to modern or traditional views (Odds ratios: 3.618 for post-secular vs. modern).
   - Women are over twice as likely to have post-secular views than men (Odds ratio: 2.037).
   - Political conservatism correlates with post-secular views.

5. **Conclusions**: The study concludes that most Americans lean towards either science or religion, but few reconcile both. The results identify three distinct perspectives that align with broader conflict theories. Notably, 21% of respondents maintain a nuanced post-secular perspective where conflict between science and religion persists even amidst moderate science literacy.

Overall, this research underscores the complexities of public perceptions of science and religion, suggesting that while some individuals may find harmony between the two, substantial divisions remain, particularly influenced by demographic factors and religious affiliations.

The document examines the intersection of perspectives on science and religion within the context of U.S. political conflicts, particularly focusing on controversial issues such as abortion rights, stem cell research, and genetically modified (GM) food. 

**Methodologies:**
- Analysis involved logistic regression models to assess the relationship between perspectives on science and religion and attitudes towards various political issues.
- A sample from the General Social Survey (GSS) was utilized, with a focus on different latent classes: traditional, modern, and post-secular.

**Key Metrics and Results:**
1. **Abortion Rights:**
   - The post-secular class showed the strongest opposition to abortion (p < .05) compared to the traditional class, while the modern class demonstrated majority support (p < .05).
   - Control variables indicated that political conservatives and frequent religious service attendees were more likely to oppose abortion rights (p < .001).

2. **Stem Cell Research:**
   - Similar patterns as abortion rights, with post-secular individuals opposing government funding more than traditionalists (p < .05).
   
3. **Genetically Modified Food:**
   - The modern class reported more support compared to the post-secular group, although this was marginally significant (p < .10).

4. **Fuel Economy Standards/Nuclear Energy:**
   - Attitudes were largely insignificant, indicating these issues do not significantly clash with religious beliefs compared to life-related issues.

**Conclusions:**
- The data suggest that perspectives on science and religion are critical in shaping political attitudes, especially in debates where both authority systems claim jurisdiction.
- Traditionalists exhibit more opposition broadly to scientific consensus in life-related issues, while modernists favor scientific perspectives.
- The post-secular perspective complicates binary divisions by suggesting a nuanced view where science and religion may conflict prominently on specific life issues but can co-exist on others.
- The analysis reinforces the idea that religious and scientific perspectives are deeply embedded in U.S. political discourse and cultural context.

Overall, the findings stress that the framing of debates on life-related issues is crucial in understanding public opinion, revealing significant ideological dilemmas shaped by underlying religio-scientific perspectives.

The paper explores the relationship between religious commitment, views on science, and social status, revealing insights into the post-secular perspective. Key findings include:

1. **Methodology**:
   - Utilized unique survey questions from the General Social Survey (GSS) to assess public perspectives on science and religion. 
   - Examined sociodemographic factors, political attitudes, and beliefs about the Bible, scientific theories (like evolution and the big bang), and scientific research benefits.

2. **Metrics**:
   - Findings indicate that three out of five Americans hold views diverging from mainstream scientific understanding, particularly regarding creation and evolution.
   - Historical underscoring of modernity's links to rationalism, which contrasts with the persistence of religious beliefs, with a majority still believing in miracles.

3. **Results**:
   - The post-secular perspective emerges as particularly religiously committed, defying expected associations with higher socioeconomic status and scientific views.
   - Identified clusters of interpretations correspond to social cleavages, underpinning significant political conflicts.
   - Found a decoupling of individual beliefs in science from institutional religious positions, exemplified by discrepancies within the Catholic community regarding scientific acceptance.

4. **Conclusions**:
   - The post-secular viewpoint does not represent a midpoint between traditional and modern perspectives; it presents a distinct framework for interpreting reality through both science and religion.
   - The study suggests that while conflicts between science and religion exist, many individuals perceive these domains as compatible.
   - Calls for future research on how these perspectives evolve historically and individually, emphasizing the need for refined data collection methods to examine religion and science across various domains.

The article highlights the complexity of cultural identities within U.S. society, especially regarding religion and science, and encourages exploring the nuanced relationships that inform public beliefs and political behaviors.

The research studies the relationship between religious traditions and perspectives on science, showing significant differences in beliefs among various religious groups. Notably, Baptists make up 21% and Pentecostals 11% of traditionalists, compared to lower percentages in modern perspectives (10% and 6%, respectively). Nondenominational conservative Protestants are more prevalent in the post-secular category (22% vs. 14% for traditionalists).

Key methodologies included statistical tests such as chi-square analysis (X² = 346.94; p < .001) to confirm that religious traditions significantly influence belief classes, largely independent of other sociodemographic factors. However, Black Protestants showed higher traditionalism, which lost significance when controlling for race, suggesting their doctrinal beliefs overlap with other conservative Christians but manifest differently regarding science.

The study further identified jointly significant effects of race (X² = 86.77; p < .001) and occupational status (X² = 33.49; p < .001) variables on participants' religious-scientific perspectives. The findings imply that while conservative Christian traditions shape views on science and religion independently of race, the dynamics among Black Protestants are more complex, echoing previous research indicating different approaches to the science-religion boundary. 

In conclusion, the research highlights the nuanced interplay of religious tradition and socio-demographic factors in shaping beliefs about science, advocating for deeper exploration into these relationships in future studies. Specific metrics and statistical significance underline the study's credibility and the importance of its findings in understanding contemporary socioreligious discourse.

**Summary of "Traditional, Modern, and Post-Secular Perspectives on Science and Religion in the United States"**

**Authors:** Timothy L. O’Brien and Shiri Noy  
**Published in:** American Sociological Review, 2015, Vol. 80(1), pp. 92-115  
**DOI:** 10.1177/0003122414558919

**Objective:**  
The study investigates how perspectives on science and religion coexist in the United States, using data from the General Social Survey. It explores the complexities of the relationship between science and religion amidst sociological theories suggesting a modern replacement of religious faith by scientific rationality.

**Methodology:**  
- **Data Source:** General Social Survey data.
- **Analytical Technique:** Latent class analysis was employed to classify individuals based on their knowledge and attitudes regarding science and religion.  
- **Categories Identified:** 
  - **Traditional Perspective** (43%): Prefers religion over science.
  - **Modern Perspective** (36%): Prefers science over religion.
  - **Post-Secular Perspective** (21%): Views both science and religion positively but favors religion when faced with competing explanations, such as creation and evolution.

**Findings:**
- The analysis reveals that a majority of people align with either the traditional or modern perspective, indicating a preference for either scientific or religious explanations of the world.
- The post-secular group uniquely reconciles both viewpoints but remains primarily religious in contemplation.
- Interestingly, the study finds that attitudes toward science and religion shape political stances on issues such as abortion rights and stem cell research, showcasing cultural and epistemological divides rather than straightforward denominational differences.

**Results:**  
- **Perspective Distribution:** About 43% hold traditional views favoring religion, 36% modern views favoring science, and 21% align with post-secular views. 
- The perspectives do not reflect demographic or ideological divides typically associated with these beliefs.
- The study challenges existing theories of secularization by suggesting that many individuals do not see these two realms as inherently conflicting and may draw from both when making sense of complex issues.

**Conclusions:**  
The article concludes that the relationship between science and religion is more intricate than merely conflicting. Instead, the findings indicate a rich tapestry of perspectives that contribute to cultural politics in the U.S. These insights underscore the relevance of examining science and religion not only as opposing domains but as intertwined frameworks that inform individuals' understanding of various social issues.

**Keywords:** science, religion, political culture, secularization, cultural conflict

The text discusses the relationships between science, religion, and individual perspectives in the United States over the past forty years, contrasting with trends observed in Europe. It challenges secularization theories by highlighting that religious participation remains stable while public support for science is also present. The document introduces the concept of a "post-secular" society, where individuals blend scientific and religious viewpoints in their worldviews, implying that both belief systems can coexist without inherent conflict.

Key Methodologies:
1. **Data Source**: Analysis utilizes cross-sectional data from the General Social Survey (GSS) covering 2006, 2008, and 2010.
2. **Sample Size**: The analysis includes a total of 2,901 respondents across the three survey years, with varying sample sizes due to split-ballot design.
3. **Variables**: Perspectives on science and religion are measured using attitudes toward science and knowledge of scientific concepts through survey questions and quiz-style assessments.

Specific Metrics:
- **Attitudinal Measures**: Four main questions assess public appreciation of science, evaluated on four- and five-point scales.
- **Knowledge Assessment**: 14 true/false quiz questions gauge basic scientific knowledge.

Findings:
1. **Ideal Types of Perspectives**: The text outlines four ideal types regarding science and religion:
   - Modern: Positive views on science, negative views on religion.
   - Traditional: Negative views on science, positive views on religion.
   - Post-Secular: Positive views on both.
   - Postmodern: Skeptical of both science and religion.

2. **Sociodemographic Correlates**: 
   - Regular attendance at religious services is linked to favorable views of religion.
   - Different religious traditions influence perspectives on science differently; conservative Protestants are more likely to reject scientific narratives.
   - Gender differences reveal women generally hold less favorable views of science.
   - Racial and ethnic minorities, such as African Americans and Latinos, show lower favorability towards science but higher religiosity.
   - Educational attainment and socioeconomic status positively correlate with favorable views of science.

Conclusions:
- Individuals' perspectives on science and religion are distinct and shaped by various sociodemographic factors.
- The frameworks provided help in understanding how these views influence political attitudes and conflicts related to issues where science and religion intersect.
- Overall, the data indicates a complex landscape where there is no single dominant perspective; rather individuals express a variety of views that serve to explain their understanding of the world while linking these concepts with political inclinations.

The document reports on an analysis investigating public perspectives on science and religion using data from the General Social Survey (GSS) from 2006, 2008, and 2010. Key metrics from survey questions reflect varying levels of agreement on topics such as the nature of the universe, human evolution, and health-related probabilities with specific numerical values indicating response means and standard deviations.

### Methodologies
- **Latent Class Analysis (LCA)** was employed to identify underlying patterns in attitudes toward science and religion, focusing on responses to conceptually related questions.
- The model fit for LCA was evaluated using **Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood-ratio tests (LMR)** and the **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)** to determine the optimal number of latent classes.

### Results
- The LCA revealed three distinct classes of respondents based on their perspectives on scientific issues, religious beliefs, and political attitudes:
  - Traditional
  - Modern
  - Post-secular
- Significant differences were reported among these groups on various measures, with noteworthy statistics indicating specific patterns, such as:
  - Responses on whether "the Sun goes around the Earth" had a mean score of **0.756** for the traditional class and **0.430** for the modern class.
  - Views on the Bible being "the actual word of God" showed a mean of **0.309** across the entire sample.
- The paper also assessed sociological characteristics such as age, ethnicity, income, education, and political ideology related to the respondents’ classifications.
  
### Conclusions
- The analysis demonstrated significant relationships between beliefs about science and religion and the sociocultural background of individuals.
- Statistical results included noteworthy correlations on specific issues like abortion rights, stem cell research funding, and consumption of genetically modified foods, with responses varied by the identified latent class. For example, the mean support for stem cell research was **3.013**, with variations across different classes.
- The synthesis of the data suggests cultural distinctions in understanding science, religious beliefs, and their intersecting implications for attitudes toward political issues.

The document emphasizes the complex interplay between science, religion, and social attitudes in the U.S., offering insights into how cultural values shape public understanding.

The document provides an analysis of latent class analysis (LCA) regarding the perspectives on science and religion among U.S. respondents using data from the General Social Survey (GSS) across 2006, 2008, and 2010 (n = 2,901). Fit statistics, particularly the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Lo-Mendell-Rubin (LMR) likelihood-ratio test, indicate that a six-class model yields the lowest BIC, but further analysis favors a three-class model. 

### Key Findings:
1. **Class Distribution**:
   - **Traditional Perspective**: Represents 43% of respondents, characterized by a traditional view on science and religion.
   - **Modern Perspective**: Comprises 36%, marked by a modern approach to these themes.
   - **Post-Secular Perspective**: Accounts for 21%, blending aspects of both views.

2. **Science Literacy Metrics**:
   - Traditional adherents have significantly lower science literacy; for instance, only 47% correctly answered that radioactivity occurs naturally, compared to 92% of the modern class.
   - The belief that the Bible is the literal word of God is held by 46% of the traditional class versus 3% in the modern class, indicating stark differences in views on religious texts.

3. **Sociodemographics**:
   - The traditional class includes a higher proportion of women, African Americans, and Latinos, as well as individuals from lower social strata.
   - Members of the post-secular class tend to be older, politically conservative, and from the South, despite having similar incomes to modern individuals.

4. **Multinomial Logistic Regression Findings**:
   - Compared to mainline Protestants, conservative Protestants are 3.618 times more likely to identify as post-secular rather than modern.
   - Women are significantly more likely than men to hold post-secular views (odds ratio of 2.037).
   - Results suggest that individuals with a post-secular perspective are more politically conservative and attend religious services more frequently than those with modern or traditional views.

### Conclusions:
The LCA reveals three distinct attitudes toward science and religion in the U.S. Many individuals favor either science or religion, with limited overlaps. The post-secular class demonstrates some conflict resolution between scientific understanding and religious beliefs, yet this group significantly subscribes to religious interpretations of certain scientific concepts, indicating an ongoing tension between the two spheres. Overall, the findings indicate a nuanced understanding of how demographic factors influence perceptions and attitudes towards science and religion.

The document analyzes varying perspectives on science and religion in the political context of the United States, particularly regarding contentious socio-political issues such as abortion rights, stem cell research, and genetically modified food. Key findings include:

### Methodologies:
1. **Regression Analysis**: Logistic regression models were applied to assess the impact of science-religion perspectives over attitudes towards several socio-political issues, controlling for a range of demographic variables.
2. **Latent Class Analysis**: Responses were categorized into three latent classes—traditional, post-secular, and modern—to identify differences in attitudes.
3. **Statistical Testing**: P-values were computed to determine the significance of differences (e.g., p < .05 for most notable relationships).

### Specific Metrics:
- **Odds Ratios from Logistic Regressions**: Key results are displayed in Table 6, detailing the associations between perspectives and issue support.
  - *Support Right to Choose Abortion*: Traditional perspective odds ratio = 0.426 (p < .001), post-secular = 0.261 (p < .001).
  - *Support Funding for Stem Cell Research*: Traditional perspective odds ratio = 0.598 (p < .05), post-secular = 0.367 (p < .001).
  - *Support for GM Food*: Traditional = 0.451 (p < .001), post-secular = 0.647 (not statistically significant).
  - Issue areas like fuel economy and nuclear energy did not show significant association with science-religion perspectives.

### Results:
1. **Differing Attitudes**: The post-secular class exhibited significantly greater opposition to abortion rights and stem cell research compared to the traditional class.
2. **Support Patterns**: Only the modern class showed majority support for abortion rights, while traditional and post-secular groups aligned more closely with religious views opposing these rights.
3. **Cultural Significance**: The study highlighted that scientific authority plays a critical role in areas where it competes with religious authority, particularly regarding life-related issues.
4. **Control Variables**: Political conservatism and religious service attendance were significant predictors of opposition to abortion and stem cell funding, alongside gender effects favoring women's support for abortion rights.

### Conclusions:
- **Religio-Scientific Conflict**: The findings suggest that the discursive framing of political issues is essential in embedding them within broader attitudes towards science and religion. Political debates on reproductive rights and genetic issues often arise out of direct conflicts between differing authorities of science and religion.
- **Overlap of Jurisdictions**: Science and religion hold overlapping jurisdictions on certain topics, leading to ideological dilemmas for individuals who must navigate competing interpretations.
- **Broader Implications**: The research indicates that perspectives on science and religion significantly shape U.S. political culture, influencing public opinion, and clarifying that traditional views represent more marginalized social identities compared to modern perspectives.

Overall, the study concludes that understanding the interplay between religio-scientific perspectives and socio-political attitudes is crucial for grasping political dynamics surrounding issues deeply embedded in cultural and religious contexts.

This article investigates the relationship between religious commitment, views on science, and socioeconomic status in the U.S. It challenges the notion that conservative religious commitment and social marginalization are inherently connected, proposing instead that a post-secular perspective exhibits robust religious commitment while often being associated with higher socioeconomic status. 

Key methodologies include the analysis of unique survey questions fielded in the General Social Survey (GSS), which were specifically crafted to explore beliefs regarding the Bible, scientific research, human evolution, and the big bang. The results indicate that more than 60% of the U.S. public holds beliefs that diverge from mainstream scientific views, particularly on creation and evolution, with many still believing in miracles as observed throughout the twentieth century.

The findings reveal a significant decoupling between individual beliefs about science and religion and the official positions of religious institutions, highlighting that people's views do not always align with religious authority—for example, some Catholics reject the big bang theory while the Church accepts it. This suggests that individual worldviews are shaped more by personal beliefs than by direct teachings from religious institutions.

Moreover, despite a chronic conflict narrative between science and religion, many individuals perceive these two domains as compatible. The post-secular perspective is framed not as a midpoint between traditional and modern views but as a distinct interpretative framework that encompasses aspects of both. 

The article concludes with the implication that future research should explore how perspectives on science and religion evolve over time and influence political culture and social behavior. The research underscores the complexity of religio-scientific perspectives as a crucial element in understanding societal divisions in the contemporary U.S. context. 

Acknowledgments are given to various contributors, and the study received funding from the National Science Foundation under grant number SRS 0935815. The authors note that their classification of perspectives, including fundamentalist and evangelical traditions, is based on prior studies while acknowledging historical distinctions among these groups. 

In summary, the study provides important insights into the intricate relationship between science, religion, and societal perspectives, calling for deeper exploration of these themes in future sociological research.

The study investigates the relationship between religious traditions, particularly among conservative Christians, and their impact on religio-scientific perspectives. Key findings include:

1. **Demographics**: 
   - Baptist (21%) and Pentecostal (11%) individuals make up a larger share of traditionalists when compared to nondenominational conservatives (14% vs. 22% in the post-secular class).
   
2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Religious traditions are found to be jointly significant (X² = 346.94; p < .001).
   - The analysis indicates that the relationship between religious traditions and latent classes is largely independent of other sociodemographic characteristics. Notably, Black Protestants show a higher likelihood of holding traditional views over modern ones but this significance diminishes when controlling for race.

3. **Race and Occupation**:
   - Race (X² = 86.77; p < .001) and occupational status (X² = 33.49; p < .001) have significant effects on the outcome model, illustrating that both structural elements influence religio-scientific perspectives.

4. **Conclusions**:
   - The study aligns with Shelton and Emerson’s (2012) observations that while conservative Christian traditions can influence perspectives on science independently of race, the same does not hold for Black Protestant traditions, suggesting differing interactions between religion and views on science.

Overall, the findings imply that religious affiliation plays a critical role in shaping attitudes toward science, with significant variances based on racial and occupational demographics.

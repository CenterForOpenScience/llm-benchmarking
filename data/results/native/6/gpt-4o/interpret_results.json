  "interpretation_summary": "The replication study was executed successfully, following the planned methodology closely. The replication used more recent waves of the GSS dataset and employed a Python script for data cleaning, latent class analysis, and hypothesis testing. The replication tested the hypothesis that respondents with a post-secular perspective are less likely to believe in human evolution compared to those with a traditional perspective. The T-test statistic was -21.10 with a p-value of 4.54e-90, indicating a significant difference between the groups.",

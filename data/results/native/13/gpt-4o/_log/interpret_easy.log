The hypothesis tested was about the positive association between individuals' concerns about immigration and distrust in their country's parliament. The results show statistically significant positive coefficients for the predictor variable "imm_concern" in both the original and imputed data analyses.

Next, I will read the `post_registration.json` to gather information about the original study's claim and methods, which will help in comparing the original and replication results. This will also aid in assessing the fidelity of the replication.

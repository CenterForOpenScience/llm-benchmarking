  "interpretation_summary": "The replication study successfully tested the hypothesis that concerns about immigration are positively associated with distrust in political institutions. The replication used a similar dataset from the European Social Survey and applied multilevel modeling, aligning well with the original study's methodology. The replication found statistically significant positive coefficients for immigration concerns, consistent with the original study's findings.",

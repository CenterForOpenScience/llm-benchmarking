***Agent output:
Thought: The R script primarily focuses on gender differences in anxiety measures (`mh_anxiety_1` and `mh_anxiety_3`) and does not address age differences, which are crucial for replicating the original study's claim. The script uses t-tests to compare anxiety scores between genders and calculates Cohen's d for effect size. However, the absence of an age variable in the dataset is a significant limitation for replicating the original study's claim about age differences in risk perception.

Given this limitation, I need to ask for a different data source that includes age information to ensure the replication study can adequately test the original claim.

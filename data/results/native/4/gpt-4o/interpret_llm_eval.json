  "fidelity_assessment.method_alignment": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The method alignment is mostly similar, mentioning the use of T-tests and gender differences, but omits the specific use of a two-tailed test and the exact variables used."

  "results_comparison.overall_answer": {
    "score": 3,
    "explanation": "The overall answer correctly states that the replication results satisfy the preregistered comparison criteria for the gender-related claim."
  },
  "replication_report": {
    "score": 2,
    "explanation": "The replication report is mostly similar, confirming the hypothesis with gender differences, but lacks specific statistical details like the exact p-value."

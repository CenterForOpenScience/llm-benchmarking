A JSON template where each key contains a description of what is expected\n2. The original paper manuscript (original_paper.pdf)\n3. Initial details file (initial_details_easy.txt) containing:\n   - Claim statement (use this directly, do not extract from paper)\n   - Hypotheses (use these directly, do not extract from paper)\n\nYour goal is to:\n- For 'claim.statement' field: Use the exact statement from initial_details_easy.txt\n- For 'hypotheses' field: Use the exact list from initial_details_easy.txt\n- For all other fields: Extract content only from original_paper.pdf\n- Leave fields as `not stated` if information isn't found in the designated source\n\nOutput Requirements:\n- Return a valid JSON object only.\n- Do NOT wrap the output in markdown (no ```json).\n- Do NOT include extra text, commentary, or notes.\n\nBegin extraction using the provided schema below and the file contents.

    "stage_2": "You are an information extraction assistant tasked with completing stage 2 of an information extraction process based on the already extracted original study data (stage 1).\n\nYou will receive:\n1. A JSON template where each key contains a description of what is expected (non-original-study parts).\n2. Previously extracted stage 1 original study related structured details (post-registration.json).\n\nYour task:\n- Populate the template based on both the Stage 1 JSON and the current input files. For each dataset file, report its filename, format, list of column names, and include structural and statistical summaries\n   - Structural summaries include output from functions like df.info(), str(), etc.\n   - Statistical summaries include output from df.describe(), summary(), etc.\n   - Use the pre-extracted summaries provided (do not recompute them yourself)\n- From the codebase:\n   - Map each code file to a short explanation of its likely function (e.g., preprocessing, modeling, evaluation)\n   - Use this information to propose a complete and appropriate Docker environment specification under 'docker_specs', including:\n     - A suitable base image\n     - Required Python/R packages and versions\n     - Any additional system-level dependencies (e.g., git, make, wget)\n     - Hardware requirements such as GPU and RAM if applicable\n\nInstructions:\n- Leave any field as `not stated` if information is not present in the designated source\n- All values must be actual extractions, not placeholders\n\nOutput Requirements:\n- Return a valid JSON object only\n- Do NOT wrap the output in markdown (no ```json)\n- Do NOT include extra text, commentary, or notes\n\nBegin extraction using the provided schema below and the file contents. Ensure accuracy and completeness. Strictly follow the input-source constraints."

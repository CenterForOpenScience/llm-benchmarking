Crop Income (DV),WBHH,,,Crop income is total value of sales of all crops over the past year and excludes crops for the purpose of household consumption. The amount of land owned (in acres) reported is conditional on owning land at all. Crop income per acre is equal to the total value of sales of all crops over the past year divided by the total land.,,,rd99015; rd99043,See transformation,Agricultural Receipts/Area = (rd99015.q50 + rd99043.q51)/rd99015.q15 (each variable summed across all crop types),Total of all agricultural income divided by area under cultivation in previous year,raw_inc_per_acre,Replication is constructed from multiple variables rather than reported directly; unclear whether original includes miscellaneous farm income or not
Lower caste (selection),WBHH,HHLIST,caste,"Sample is low
caste (BAC, OBC, SC).","Backward (Agri-Based) (3), Backward (Other) (4), Scheduled Caste (5)",,rd99001,q11 and q51,"Coded 1 if REDS labels as BC/OBC/SC/ST (q11) or as low-caste (q51) or Yadav (BAC, q11) or in scheduled/backward caste lists (for Bihar and Uttar Pradesh only)",Maximal definition of low-caste (low-caste by any definition is coded to low),locaste,No hard-coded match to original; combination of caste group variable in REDS with recodes of specific castes; also not clear whether ST included in original study but couldn't be fully separated here
Land ownership (control),WBHH,SECT09A,v09a01,"The amount of land owned (in acres) reported is conditional on owning land
at all.",Total agricultural land owned (in ACRES) if > 0; else missing,Literal number of acres,rd99010 and rd99012,q8/q11 (rd99010) and q35,Land owned at end of reporting period or (if missing) land before inheritance plus inherited,Must own land to calcuate crop income variable,land_owned,
Low-caste village,WBV,VILL01A1,q1a07*,"Information on the village caste composition comes from village level questionnaires.
Land ownership is either in the hands of the upper castes or the lower
castes (the BACs) (48 percent and 42 percent respectively). This is the key variation
in the data, which we will exploit. We will compare villages where upper
castes own most of the land (termed high-caste villages in the tables that follow),
to villages where the BACs own most of the land (termed low-caste villages in the
tables that follow)","Please rank the four or five important castes in the village, in terms of numbers, as well as
their rankings in terms of land ownership",1 if highest-ranking caste in land ownership (q1a07d*) is BAC (3)/OBC (4)/SC(ST) (5) (q1a07b*); 0 if highest-ranking is UC (1); Missing if Muslim (7 or 8),"rd99001, rd99010 and rd99012",caste (see above) and land_owned (see above),,Coded 1 if low-caste HHs own more total land as reported in survey than all other HHs,locaste_land_v,Original study used reports by key informant (village leader); replication relies on land ownership reported in survey responses
Literacy (control),WBHH,SECT01A,v01a05,None,Educational attainment,1 (Illiterate) = 0; 2-11 (Literate and/or educated) = 1,rd99002,q15,q15>1 for HH member,Coded 1 if anyone in household is literate or educated,literate_hh,
State (FE),WBHH,HHLIST,state,Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,,,rd99001,q8,none,All states (but used for FE),stcode,Includes all states - the survey in the original paper was only of the 2 specific states but we have data on all states
Village (clustering/FE),,,village,,,,rd99001,vill_id,none,Unique identifier for village; matches to village-level data,vill_id,

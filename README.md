# LLM Benchmarking Project

Welcome to the official repository for the **LLM Benchmarking Project**, led by the Center for Open Science (COS). This project aims to evaluate the capabilities of large language model (LLM) agents across key components of the scientific research lifecycle, including **replication**, **peer review**, and **research design**.

## 🔍 What This Project Is About

We are developing a modular benchmark framework to assess whether and how LLM agents can:

* **Replicate published scientific findings**
* **Evaluate the quality and credibility of research outputs**
* **Generate valid and meaningful research designs**

This work builds on the conceptual structure outlined in our Open Philanthropy grant, emphasizing real-world relevance, task diversity, and community participation.

## 🚧 Current Status

This repository is in **active development**. Right now, it hosts internal work on:

* Task definitions for replication benchmarking
* Agent development and evaluation pipelines
* Experimental scaffolding for testing and refining agent performance

Over time, we will open up parts of this repo for **community use and feedback**, including:

* Evaluation harnesses
* Benchmarks and datasets
* Contribution guidelines for task submissions and agent evaluation strategies
